Challenges abound at every turn, and Adrien, who has become silent, distant, and tormented by his visions of the future, only adds to the growing certainty of defeat. But worst of all, as Zoe''s team fights against impossible odds, distrust and betrayal leads to the terrible discovery that their greatest threat could already be lurking behind the safe walls of the Foundation.

We walk on it, drive on it, and many of us live and work within its walls. But very few of us know what it is. We take for granted this ubiquitous substance, which both literally and figuratively comprises much of modern civilization’s constructed environment; yet the story of its creation and development features a cast of fascinating characters and remarkable historical episodes. This book delves into this history, opening readers’ eyes at every turn. In a lively narrative peppered with intriguing details, author Robert Corland describes how some of the most famous personalities of history became involved in the development and use of concrete—including King Herod the Great of Judea, the Roman emperor Hadrian, Thomas Edison (who once owned the largest concrete cement plant in the world), and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Courland points to recent archaeological evidence suggesting that the discovery of concrete directly led to the Neolithic Revolution and the rise of the earliest civilizations. Much later, the Romans reached extraordinarily high standards for concrete production, showcasing their achievement in iconic buildings like the Coliseum and the Pantheon. Amazingly, with the fall of the Roman Empire, the secrets of concrete manufacturing were lost for over a millennium. The author explains that when concrete was rediscovered in the late eighteenth century it was initially viewed as an interesting novelty or, at best, a specialized building material suitable only for a narrow range of applications. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that the use of concrete exploded. During this rapid expansion, industry lobbyists tried to disguise the fact that modern concrete had certain defects and critical shortcomings. It is now recognized that modern concrete, unlike its Roman predecessor, gradually disintegrates with age. Compounding this problem is another distressing fact: the manufacture of concrete cement is a major contributor to global warming. Concrete Planet is filled with incredible stories, fascinating characters, surprising facts, and an array of intriguing insights into the building material that forms the basis of the infrastructure on which we depend.

From the Foreword by Kenneth Frampton: "Concrete remains a valuable historical text that in many respects has never been given its due. It is an unmatched pioneering history of the development of reinforced concrete up to 1914.

This last step is not a trivial step, and that is why so many books, and courses, present only theory and simulations. With the combined expertise of the three authors of this text...the reader can step into the real-time world of applications with a text that presents an accessible path..." —Delores M. Etter, Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Electrical Engineering and Executive Director, Caruth Institute for Engineering Education, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, USA Mastering practical application of real-time digital signal processing (DSP) remains one of the most challenging and time-consuming pursuits in the field. It is even more difficult without a resource to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Filling that void, Real-Time Digital Signal Processing from MATLAB® to C with the TMS320C6x DSPs, Second Edition is organized in three sections that cover enduring fundamentals and present practical projects and invaluable appendices. This updated edition gives readers hands-on experience in real-time DSP using a practical, step-by-step framework that also incorporates demonstrations, exercises, and problems, coupled with brief overviews of applicable theory and MATLAB® application. Engineers, educators, and students rely on this book for precise, simplified instruction on use of real-time DSP applications. The book’s software supports the latest high-performance hardware, including the powerful, inexpensive, and versatile OMAP-L138 Experimenter Kit and other development boards.

This third edition has been completely rewritten to provide detailed and up-to-date coverage of key concepts, algorithms, technologies, and applications. The authors explain the principles, as well as the mathematics, underlying computer graphics-knowledge that is essential for successful work both now and in the future. Early chapters show how to create 2D and 3D pictures right away, supporting experimentation. Later chapters, covering a broad range of topics, demonstrate more sophisticated approaches. Sections on current computer graphics practice show how to apply given principles in common situations, such as how to approximate an ideal solution on available hardware, or how to represent a data structure more efficiently. Topics are reinforced by exercises, program­ming problems, and hands-on projects. This revised edition features New coverage of the rendering equation, GPU architecture considerations, and importance- sampling in physically based rendering An emphasis on modern approaches, as in a new chapter on probability theory for use in Monte-Carlo rendering Implementations of GPU shaders, software rendering, and graphics-intensive 3D interfaces 3D real-time graphics platforms-their design goals and trade-offs-including new mobile and browser platforms Programming and debugging approaches unique to graphics development The text and hundreds of figures are presented in full color throughout the book.

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing--and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship. Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn''t Have to Suck!"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don''t understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security. Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi''s website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom.

One policy that meets these criteria and warrants consideration is a farm savings account (FSA). It is crucial that the role of a FSA in a farm household''s portfolio is understood before implementing it as policy. Consequently, this research uses a discrete stochastic programming model to investigate the relationship between the FSA and the portfolio allocation choices (consumption, land allocation, stock, and debt) for a utility-maximizing farmer in a theoretical and empirical framework. This analysis shows that a FSA can help stabilize, enhance, and/or reduce the variability in wealth. The results also suggest that the availability of a FSA as an investment has significant impact on the asset allocation patterns for the household. First, the presence of matching government contributions motivates the household in ever year when they have sufficient cash to contribute funds to the FSA to receive these government contributions. This result occurs irrespective of the initial endowments, risk aversion level, and presence of other U.S. farm policies. Access to the FSA causes the household to decrease purchases of stocks compared to a household without access to the FSA. Second, the powerful income protection effects of the FSA help explain the observed willingness of the household to make annual land purchase decisions that are far larger than in the scenario without the FSA. In turn, this causes the household to have a much larger percentage of its assets financed with debt capital. The availability of a FSA results in modest increases in average terminal wealth, lower variability in terminal wealth, and no significant change in average annual consumption, but lower variability in consumption. Finally, as the amount of farmland in the portfolio grows, a decrease in the probability of a withdrawal and an increase in the size of the average withdrawal from the FSA can be observed. These results are consistent with prior research on the National Income Stabilization Account (NISA), a Canadian farm policy similar to the FSA.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '287', '2007', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4q7rZArbASYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Effect of Farm Savings Accounts on Farm Households'' Portfolios')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

In his view, a Motk insulator displays a gap for charge-carrying excitations due to electron cowelations, whose importance is expressed by the presence of local magnetic moments regardless of whether or not they are ordered. Since the subject is far from being settled, different opinions on specific aspects of the Mott transition still persist. This book naturally embodies my own understanding of the phenomenon, inspired by the work of the late Sir Kevill Mott. The purpose of this book is twofold: first, to give a detailed presen- tion of the basic theoretical concopts for Mott insulators and, second, to test these ideas against the results from model calculations. For this purpose the Hubbard model and some of its derivatives are best suited. The Hubbard model describes a Mott transition with a mere minimum of tunable par- eters, and various exact statements and even exact solutions exist in certain limiting cases.

Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books. To begin the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing three, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which will be published at regular intervals. Each fascicle will encompass a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete. Volume 4, Fascicle 4 This latest fascicle covers the generation of all trees, a basic topic that has surprisingly rich ties to the first three volumes of The Art of Computer Programming. In thoroughly discussing this well-known subject, while providing 124 new exercises, Knuth continues to build a firm foundation for programming. To that same end, this fascicle also covers the history of combinatorial generation.

EPICURE is designed to generate text from underlying plans.

This technology promises new levels of system integration onto a single chip, but also presents significant challenges to the chip designer. As a result, many ASIC developers and silicon vendors are re-examining their design methodologies, searching for ways to make effective use of the huge numbers of gates now available. These designers see current design tools and methodologies as inadequate for developing million-gate ASICs from scratch. There is considerable pressure to keep design team size and design schedules constant while design complexities grow. Tools are not providing the productivity gains required to keep pace with the increasing gate counts available from deep submicron technology. Design reuse - the use of pre-designed and pre-verified cores - is the most promising opportunity to bridge the gap between available gate-count and designer productivity. Reuse Methodology Manual for System-On-A-Chip Designs outlines an effective methodology for creating reusable designs for use in a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) design methodology. Silicon and tool technologies move so quickly that no single methodology can provide a permanent solution to this highly dynamic problem. Instead, this manual is an attempt to capture and incrementally improve on current best practices in the industry, and to give a coherent, integrated view of the design process. From the Foreword `Synopsys and Mentor Graphics have joined forces to help make IP reuse a reality. One of the goals of our Design Reuse Partnership is to develop, demonstrate, and document a reuse-based design methodology that works. The Reuse Manual (RMM) is the result of this effort.''

For more than ten years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has criticized federal agencies for a history of cost and schedule overruns on a significant portion of their procurement programs. GAO has repeatedly reported that the use of immature technologies in programs is a primary cause for these overruns. In spite of these repeated reports, the problems in government procurement have not improved. In fact, recent reports indicate that the problems are getting worse. One cause of this worsening situation might be that, while GAO identified lack of technology maturity as a problem, they did not tell how to measure technology maturity, or conversely, its lack. This groundbreaking work attempts to fill this gap by examining the current state of technology maturity measurement, pointing out strengths and weaknesses of available measures, and proposing a complete technology maturity assessment as a potential solution.

Citizens are increasingly using initiatives and referendums to take the law into their own hands, overriding their elected officials to set tax, expenditure, and social policies. John G. Matsusaka''s For the Many or the Few provides the first even-handed and historically based treatment of the subject. Drawing upon a century of evidence, Matsusaka argues against the popular belief that initiative measures are influenced by wealthy special interest groups that neglect the majority view. Examining demographic, political, and opinion data, he demonstrates how the initiative process brings about systematic changes in tax and expenditure policies of state and local governments that are generally supported by the citizens. He concludes that, by and large, direct democracy in the form of the initiative process works for the benefit of the many rather than the few. An unprecedented, comprehensive look at the historical, empirical, and theoretical components of how initiatives function within our representative democracy to increase political competition while avoiding the tyranny of the majority, For the Many or the Few is a most timely and definitive work.', DEFAULT, '15.12', '206', '2008-09-15', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=82lAdkl9XG0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'For the Many or the Few')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The new generation of robots is expected to safely and dependably co-habitat with humans in homes, workplaces, and c- munities, providing support in services, entertainment, education, healthcare, manufacturing, and assistance. Beyond its impact on physical robots, the body of knowledge robotics has produced is revealing a much wider rangeof applications reaching across diverse research areas and scienti?c disciplines, such as: biomechanics, haptics, n- rosciences, virtual simulation, animation, surgery, and sensor networks among others. In return, the challenges of the new emerging areas are proving an ab- dant source of stimulation and insights for the ?eld of robotics.

Mikicic dispels common misconceptions about theism and atheism and provides simple and straightforward answers to questions like: Is the U.S. a Christian nation? What are the differences between faith and reason? What are the benefits and drawbacks of religion? What are the arguments for and against theism? How accurate is the Bible? Who was Jesus? Was he unique or historical? Is religion the basis for morality? Born into a Catholic family and educated by Jesuits, M. Anton Mikicic evolved from an "a la carte" to a "recovering" Catholic and is now a full-fledged skeptic. Always fascinated by philosophy, theology, science, and religion, god is redundant is the result of his search for intellectual honesty in matters of faith.

Whereas kinematically redundant manipulators possess increased dexterity, compared to conventional non-redundant manipulators, their inverse kinematics is not unique and requires further treatment.

Patients now legally can write advance directives to govern their treatment decisions at a time of future incapacity, yet in clinical practice their wishes often are ignored. Examining the tension between incompetent patients'' prior wishes and their current best interests as well as other challenges to advance directives, Robert S. Olick offers a comprehensive argument for favoring advance instructions during the dying process. He clarifies widespread confusion about the moral and legal weight of advance directives, and he prescribes changes in law, policy, and practice that would not only ensure that directives count in the care of the dying but also would define narrow instances when directives should not be followed. Olick also presents and develops an original theory of prospective autonomy that recasts and strengthens patient and family control. While focusing largely on philosophical issues the book devotes substantial attention to legal and policy questions and includes case studies throughout. An important resource for medical ethicists, lawyers, physicians, nurses, health care professionals, and patients'' rights advocates, it champions the practical, ethical, and humane duty of taking advance directives seriously where it matters most-at the bedside of dying patients.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '248', '2001-07-18', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AcIpW6sysS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Taking Advance Directives Seriously')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This volume was a great help to many of us in pediatric cardiology who were discovering the great clinical value of the noninvasive approach to diagnosis. This gave us a ''running start'' for our own entry into the field.

Since 1980, the field of 2 D echocardiography has grown enormously in its usefulness, to the point that it has reduced the need for invasive studies, and has enhanced the precision of invasive studies when required.

She''s a product of the "burg," a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Now Stephanie''s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad''s, doing her best to sever the world''s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler, and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, fearless bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli is also the irresistible macho pig who took Stephanie''s virginity at age sixteen and then wrote the details on the bathroom wall of Mario''s Sub Shop. There''s still powerful chemistry between these two, so the chase should be interesting.

The ongoing persistence of corruption underlines that it is not only dysfunctional, but can be highly functional as well. This special issue brings together contributions from comparative politics, political science and economics which precisely focus on these (dys) functionalities of corruption in political regimes across various world regions. The question of methodological pluralism is especially important for studying corruption comparatively. While on an international level a trend towards an increased use of quantitative methods in political science as well as in economics can be observed, the special issue underlines the importance of having a pluralistic approach for grasping the complex and multi-layered effects of the phenomenon. Of similar importance is the adoption of a comparative perspective that includes different world regions in order to understand the different roles of corruption in developing, transforming and developed countries alike.

The influence of the cosolvents on the protein''s properties in aqueous solutions (solubility, aggregation, molar volume, molar compressibility and thermal denaturation temperature), at interfaces (surface and interfacial tension), in emulsions (emulsion formation and stability) and in gels (gel strength, appearance and water holding capacity) were studied. The results showed that both glycerol and sorbitol increased the thermal stability of beta-lactoglobulin, increased the attraction between protein molecules and altered protein functionality, but by different amounts. These results can be mainly attributed to the steric exclusion of sorbitol and glycerol molecules from the protein molecule surface. However, glycerol molecules can preferentially accumulate around hydrophobic parts on the protein surface, which decreases the thermal stability of the protein, thereby partially compensating for the steric exclusion effect. Thus, sorbitol had more impact on the thermal stability of the globular protein than glycerol. Overall, the impact of the cosolvents on globular protein functionality can be attributed to (i) the increase in the thermal stability of the globular protein, (ii) an alteration of the molecular interactions between protein molecules, and (iii) an increase in the viscosity of the intervening medium. These results can be used to design protein-containing food materials that have improved functional properties.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '331', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r0XCshETHF0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Influence of Water-soluble Poly-ols on Globular Protein Functionalities')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It’s what all advertisers aim to achieve in order to drive sales. But there are more profound implications here that go deeper than influencing purchase behavior. Mindshare is a really form of creative commerce and collaborative innovation. When brands aim to connect with us through unspoken gestures and aspirations that enhance the human condition, mindshare becomes a gift—an instrument of optimal experience that ignites transformation. In this illuminating new perspective on how creativity shapes the modern world, Nikos Acuña—a creativity, innovation, and marketing thought leader, embarks on a personal journey to examine the inherent processes embedded in creativity and innovation from a variety of perspectives. You’ll learn how Apple’s design-driven innovation strategies create optimal brand experiences for their customers and how Chris Anderson and TED have created a revolutionary education platform that amplifies genius on a global scale. You’ll discover how Charles Darwin’s hunch led to the most important scientific discovery of the nineteenth century, and how Anthony Robbins uses alchemy and innovation psychology to create an indestructible state of mind. You’ll meet the neuro-anatomist who discovers the meaning of life while having a stroke. You’ll learn why your lizard brain sabotages you and how your Daemon inspires you to be visionary. Ultimately, you will learn how the essence of life is driven by a creative instinct that designed the universe itself and learn how this process is expressed through fractal patterns of experience. Told in a rich lyrical style, Mindshare is a portrait of the modern creative mind and a narrative of its process, a practical guide and a plea for ambition that captures the imagination by exploring the dynamic nature of creativity and innovation as a multi-faceted and integrated craft. Mindshare suggests that building a remarkable brand, overcoming any challenge, and achieving anything in life can be found in understanding one truth—that innovation is driven by the same inherent creative instinct that fuels our desires, seeks pleasure, strives to be better, and craves to discover new worlds. It’s a process that seeks optimal design, shifts from chaos to order, from that which is unconscious to that which is conscious—a metaphysical process of transformation that strives toward knowledge and a state of perfection. There are countless books about ideas but this is the only book that explores innovation within the audacious scope and framework that truly illustrates its paradoxical and kaleidoscopic nature—the fact is that innovation is both creative and destructive, optimal and disruptive, it’s a product and a process, stable and dynamic, personal and collective, chaotic, self-reflexive, physical, psychological, fragmented, and unified—all at the same time. In the tradition of Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From, Sir Ken Robinson’s Out of Our Minds, and Jonah Lehrer’s Imagine, Mindshare empowers you with the notion that creativity is an intrinsic collective power that reveals a groundbreaking worldview—that the essence of life is not to survive but to create.', DEFAULT, '7.99', DEFAULT, '2012-09-06', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=39FUDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Mindshare')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This method, while proven, is flawed by incompleteness: the message carries no value; only what is sold does.

Through the story of Maria Ezrati, CEO of Etymologic Corporation and over 15 real world examples, executives and managers in all industries will find a philosophical and practical blueprint to understand the dynamics of a zero price. Free products operate at the pre-sales cycle as potent advertisements, and in markets creating new demand or taking share away. Beyond pure commercial strategies, Pujol highlights the social impact of mind share markets: their ability to significantly reduce scarcity - possibly eliminate it in some areas, and solve longstanding pains from public deficits and populations unable to afford basic goods in life. By targeting this hypercompetitive segment, companies can position themselves for dealing with a new age in advertising where marketing has standalone value and mind share becomes a currency.**************************************"Pujol unearths the secret sauce fueling today''s dot com darlings and shows how these business models can be applied to virtually any industry" -- Apruva Pratap, vice president of Global Strategy, InterContinental Hotels Group"For anyone new to free versus paid business strategies, not reading this book would be like jumping out of an airplane without a parachute" -- Marc Fleury, founder of JBoss and OpenRemote"Pujol presents a radical way of looking at pre-sales: Marketing is fragile unless it is productive.

The authors cut through the official static to show the truth about war, torture, and government control of the media. Static breaks the sound barrier to present the voices of dissidents, activists, and others who are often frozen out of official debate. Read Static. Become informed. Fight back.

In chapter 1, the basic fundamental behaviour and philosophy for design of structural steel is discussed, emphasising different modes of buckling and the inter-relationship between different types of analysis. In addition to this, different levels of refinement for non-linear analysis are described. An introduction is also given to the well-known P-&dgr; and P-&Dgr; effects. Chapter 2 presents the basic matrix method of analysis and gives several examples of linear analysis of semi-rigid pointed frames. It is evident from this that one must have a good understanding of first-order linear analysis before handling a second-order non-linear analysis. In chapter 3, the linearized bifurcation and second-order large deflection are compared and the detailed procedure for a second-order analysis based on the Newton-Raphson scheme is described. Chapter 4 introduces various solution schemes for tracing of post-buckling equilibrium paths and the Minimum Residual Displacement control method with arc-length load step control is employed for the post-buckling analysis of two and three dimensional structures. Chapter 5 addresses the non-linear behaviour and modelling of semi-rigid connections while several numerical functions for description of moment versus rotation curves of typical connection types are introduced. The scope of the work in chapter 6 covers semi-rigid connections and material yielding to the static analysis of steel frames. Chapter 7 studies the cyclic response of steel frames with semi-rigid joints and elastic material characteristics. In the last chapter the combined effects of semi-rigid connections and plastic hinges on steel frames under time-dependent loads are studied using a simple springs-in-series model. For computational effectiveness and efficiency, the concentrated plastic hinge concept is used throughout these studies.', DEFAULT, '160', '356', '2000-05-19', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gCYh2EXcVpMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Non-Linear Static and Cyclic Analysis of Steel Frames with Semi-Rigid Connections')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

These functions enable a profound understanding of multivariate association, which is pivotal for judging whether a large set of risky assets entails diversification effects or aggravates risk from an entrepreneurial point of view. Since serial dependence is a stylized fact of financial time series, an asymptotic theory for estimating the structure of association in this context is developed under weak assumptions. A new measure of multivariate association, based on a notion of distance to stochastic independence, is introduced. Asymptotic results as well as hypothesis tests are established which are directly applicable to important types of multivariate financial time series. To ensure that risk management properly captures the current structure of association, it is crucial to assess the constancy of the structure. Therefore, nonparametric tests for a constant copula with either a specified or unspecified change point (candidate) are derived. The thesis concludes with a study of characterizations of association between non-continuous random variables.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '176', '2012-01', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HYG14nK2OX0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Contributions to Static and Time-varying Copula-based Modeling of Multivariate Association')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The workbook, a Shingo Research Prize recipient in 1999, is filled with actual maps, as well as engaging diagrams and illustrations.The value-stream map is a paper-and-pencil representation of every process in the material and information flow, along with key data. It differs significantly from tools such as process mapping or layout diagrams because it includes information flow as well as material flow. Value-stream mapping is an overarching tool that gives managers and executives a picture of the entire production process, both value and non value-creating activities. Rather than taking a haphazard approach to lean implementation, value-stream mapping establishes a direction for the company.To encourage you to become actively involved in the learning process, Learning to See contains a case study based on a fictional company, Acme Stamping. You begin by mapping the current state of the value stream, looking for all the sources of waste. After identifying the waste, you draw a map of a leaner future state and a value-stream plan to guide implementation and review progress regularly.Written by two experts with practical experience, Mike Rother and John Shook, the workbook makes complicated concepts simple. It teaches you the reasons for introducing a mapping program and how it fits into a lean conversion.With this easy-to-use product, a company gets the tool it needs to understand and use value-stream mapping so it can eliminate waste in production processes. Start your lean transformation or accelerate your existing effort with value-stream mapping.

In general, a data stream is an unbounded data set that is produced incrementally over time, rather than being available in full before its processing begins. In this lecture, we give an overview of recent research in stream processing, ranging from answering simple queries on high-speed streams to loading real-time data feeds into a streaming warehouse for off-line analysis. We will discuss two types of systems for end-to-end stream processing: Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) and Streaming Data Warehouses (SDWs). A traditional database management system typically processes a stream of ad-hoc queries over relatively static data. In contrast, a DSMS evaluates static (long-running) queries on streaming data, making a single pass over the data and using limited working memory. In the first part of this lecture, we will discuss research problems in DSMSs, such as continuous query languages, non-blocking query operators that continually react to new data, and continuous query optimization. The second part covers SDWs, which combine the real-time response of a DSMS by loading new data as soon as they arrive with a data warehouse''s ability to manage Terabytes of historical data on secondary storage.

The true conflict of our age isn’t between the unem­ployed and the digital elite, or even the 99 percent and the 1 percent.

The solution to finding a meaningful large-scale architecture that is capable of spanning a global enterprise appears to have been met in ESB, or Enterprise Service Bus. Rather than conform to the hub-and-spoke architecture of traditional enterprise application integration products, ESB provides a highly distributed approach to integration, with unique capabilities that allow individual departments or business units to build out their integration projects in incremental, digestible chunks, maintaining their own local control and autonomy, while still being able to connect together each integration project into a larger, more global integration fabric, or grid.Enterprise Service Bus offers a thorough introduction and overview for systems architects, system integrators, technical project leads, and CTO/CIO level managers who need to understand, assess, and evaluate this new approach. Written by Dave Chappell, one of the best known and authoritative voices in the field of enterprise middleware and standards-based integration, the book drills down into the technical details of the major components of ESB, showing how it can utilize an event-driven SOA to bring a variety of enterprise applications and services built on J2EE, .NET, C/C++, and other legacy environments into the reach of the everyday IT professional.With Enterprise Service Bus, readers become well versed in the problems faced by IT organizations today, gaining an understanding of how current technology deficiencies impact business issues. Through the study of real-world use cases and integration patterns drawn from several industries using ESB--including Telcos, financial services, retail, B2B exchanges, energy, manufacturing, and more--the book clearly and coherently outlines the benefits of moving toward this integration strategy. The book also compares ESB to other integration architectures, contrasting their inherent strengths and limitations.If you are charged with understanding, assessing, or implementing an integration architecture, Enterprise Service Bus will provide the straightforward information you need to draw your conclusions about this important disruptive technology.', DEFAULT, '18.14', '276', '2004-06-25', '2', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Uhue3faV2mwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Enterprise Service Bus')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Chapter 1 provides an overview of multimedia databases and underlines the new requirements for these applications. Chapter 2 discusses the techniques used for storing and retrieving multimedia objects. Chapter 3 presents the techniques used for generating metadata for various media objects. Chapter 4 examines the mechanisms used for storing the index information needed for accessing different media objects. Chapter 5 analyzes the approaches for modeling media objects, both their temporal and spatial characteristics. Object-oriented approach, with some additional features, has been widely used to model multimedia information. The book discusses two systems that use object-oriented models: OVID (Object Video Information Database) and Jasmine. The models for representing temporal and spatial requirements of media objects are then studied. The book also describes authoring techniques used for specifying temporal and spatial characteristics of multimedia databases. Chapter 6 explains different types of multimedia queries, the methodologies for processing them and the language features for describing them. The features offered by query languages such as SQL/MM (Structured Query Language for Multimedia), PICQUERY+, and Video SQL are also studied. Chapter 7 deals with the communication requirements for multimedia databases. A client accessing multimedia data over computer networks needs to identify a schedule for retrieving various media objects composing the database. The book identifies possible ways for generating a retrieval schedule. Chapter 8 ties together the techniques discussed in the previous chapters by providing a simple architecture of a distributed multimedia database management system.

As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like—Who are these people?What’s the secret to their success? And is Chip actually that funny in real life? By renovating homes in Waco, Texas, and changing lives in such a winsome and engaging way, Chip and Joanna have become more than just the stars of Fixer Upper, they have become America’s new best friends. The Magnolia Story is the first book from Chip and Joanna, offering their fans a detailed look at their life together. From the very first renovation project they ever tackled together, to the project that nearly cost them everything; from the childhood memories that shaped them, to the twists and turns that led them to the life they share on the farm today. They both attended Baylor University in Waco. However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car into the local Firestone tire shop where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garners the attention of a television producer who notices her work on a blog one day. In The Magnolia Story fans will finally get to join the Gaines behind the scenes and discover: The time Chip ran to the grocery store and forgot to take their new, sleeping baby Joanna’s agonizing decision to close her dream business to focus on raising their children When Chip buys a houseboat, sight-unseen, and it turns out to be a leaky wreck Joanna’s breakthrough moment of discovering the secret to creating a beautiful home Harrowing stories of the financial ups and downs as an entrepreneurial couple Memories and photos from Chip and Jo’s wedding The significance of the word magnolia and why it permeates everything they do The way the couple pays the popularity of Fixer Upper forward, sharing the success with others, and bolstering the city of Waco along the way And yet there is still one lingering question for fans of the show: Is Chip really that funny? “Oh yeah,” says Joanna. “He was, and still is, my first fixer upper.”', DEFAULT, '12.99', '208', '2016-10-18', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kPapCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Magnolia Story (with Bonus Content)')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

For Powers, science is something more than the accumulation of technical data and the proliferation of theories developed to explain physical phenomena. It is an evolving body of knowledge which has important insights to contribute into the conditions which ground human experience The close and often detailed discussions of contemporary issues in science which Powers incorporates into his fiction indicate the extent to which he sees science as an inseparable component in any attempt to understand the complexities of human experience. The common ground Powers uses to link the interests of science and those of fiction into a balanced, if not always harmonious, pursuit of truth is wonder. The limitations placed on science during this century do not undermine the ability of science to influence what we can know. Nor do these limitations diminish the ability of science to inspire wonder. Quite the opposite. For Powers the true wonder of the human intellect rests in our remarkable ability to balance observation and interpretation. What he discovers again and again in his fiction is that science, like literature, is a product of the human imagination, a way to mediate between the world and our perceptions of it. The recognition that science is a cultural practice--a body of knowledge thoroughly imbued with the practices and prejudices of its historical surroundings--is a necessary first step in mending the rift separating science and literature, head and heart. The greatest insight of twentieth century science may just be the recognition that there are other ways to access the truth. Richard Powers skillful weaving of science and art is a testament that literature offers a unique vantage point from which we might learn something of value about ourselves and the world we inhabit.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '208', '2007-02-22', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NBkRtT0fQ8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Synthesizing Systems')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This bestselling book is one of the few reliable sources to help you navigate through the maze of design options. By capturing UI best practices and reusable ideas as design patterns, Designing Interfaces provides solutions to common design problems that you can tailor to the situation at hand. This updated edition includes patterns for mobile apps and social media, as well as web applications and desktop software. Each pattern contains full-color examples and practical design advice that you can use immediately. Experienced designers can use this guide as a sourcebook of ideas; novices will find a roadmap to the world of interface and interaction design. Design engaging and usable interfaces with more confidence and less guesswork Learn design concepts that are often misunderstood, such as affordances, visual hierarchy, navigational distance, and the use of color Get recommendations for specific UI patterns, including alternatives and warnings on when not to use them Mix and recombine UI ideas as you see fit Polish the look and feel of your interfaces with graphic design principles and patterns "Anyone who''s serious about designing interfaces should have this book on their shelf for reference.

They think that UI design is like graphic design—the mysterious process by which creative, latte-drinking, all-black-wearing people produce cool-looking, artistic pieces. Most programmers see themselves as analytic, logical thinkers instead—strong at reasoning, weak on artistic judgment, and incapable of doing UI design. In this brilliantly readable book, author Joel Spolsky proposes simple, logical rules that can be applied without any artistic talent to improve any user interface, from traditional GUI applications to websites to consumer electronics. Spolsky''s primary axiom, the importance of bringing the program model in line with the user model, is both rational and simple. In a fun and entertaining way, Spolky makes user interface design easy for programmers to grasp.

"Are you a strategist?" That''s the first question Cynthia Montgomery asks the business owners and senior executives from all over the world who participate in her highly regarded executive education course. It''s not a question they anticipate or care much about on opening day. But by the time the program ends, they cannot imagine leading their companies to success without being—and living the role of—a strategist. Over a series of weeks and months, Montgomery puts these accomplished executives through their paces. Using case discussions, after-hours talks, and participants'' own strategy dilemmas, she illuminates what strategy is, why it''s important, and what it takes to lead the effort. En route, she equips them to confront the most essential question facing every business leader: Does this company truly matter? In doing so, she shows that strategy is not just a tool for outwitting the competition; it is the most powerful means a leader has for shaping a company itself. The Strategist exposes all business leaders—whether they run a global enterprise or a small business—to the invaluable insights Montgomery shares with these privileged executives. By distilling the experiences and insights gleaned in the classroom, Montgomery helps leaders develop the skills and sensibilities they need to become strategists themselves.

A close approximation to ideal current source operation is demonstrated, where the drive current is shown to be insensitive to a specified loading range.

In War, Technology, and Experience aboard the USS Monitor, David A. Mindell adds a new perspective to the story as he explores how mariners—fighting "blindly" below the waterline—lived and coped with the metal monster they called the "iron coffin." Mindell shows how the iron warship emerged as an idea and became practicable, how building it drew upon and forced changes in contemporary manufacturing technology, and how the vessel captured the nineteenth-century American popular and literary imaginations. Combining technical, personal, administrative, and literary analysis, Mindell examines the experience of the men aboard the Monitor and their reactions to the thrills and dangers that accompanied the new machine. The invention surrounded men with iron and threatened their heroism, their self-image as warriors, even their lives. Mindell also examines responses to this strange new warship by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, who prophetically saw in the Civil War a portent of the mechanized warfare of the future. The story of the Monitor shows how technology changes not only the tools but also the very experience of combat, generating effects that are still felt today in the era of "smart bombs" and pushbutton wars. "We find new significance in the otherwise well-known history of the Monitor. It is no longer the story of the heroic inventor and his impenetrable weapon thrusting themselves upon a doubtful and conservative bureaucracy... It is no longer the story of a heroic battle and the machine''s epic loss soon after.

It is the place where our families meet and mingle, where we share our meals and share our dreams. So much more than just a space to live, our homes offer us a place of comfort, nourishment, and love for us and for our children. In Handmade Home, Amanda Blake Soule, author of The Creative Family and the blog SouleMama.com, offers simple sewing and craft projects for the home that reflect the needs, activities, and personalities of today’s families. As Amanda writes in the introduction, "As a crafter, I’m always looking for the next thing I want to make. As a mama, I’m always looking for the next thing we need—to do, to have, to use—as a family. The coming together of these parts is where the heart of Handmade Home lies." Filled with thirty-three projects made by reusing and repurposing materials, all of the items here offer a practical use in the home. From picnic blankets made out of repurposed bed sheets to curtains made out of vintage handkerchiefs, these projects express the sense of making something new out of something old as a way to live a more financially pared-down and simple life; lessen our impact on the earth; connect to the past and preserve a more traditional way of life; and place value on the work of the hands. Also included are projects that children can help with, allowing them to make their own special contribution to the family home. More than just a collection of projects for handmade items, this book offers the tools to create a life—and home—full of beauty, integrity, and joy. Projects include: • Papa’s Healing Cozy: This hot water bottle cover becomes a simple way to offer comfort to a sick child • Baby Sling: A simple pattern for an object that offers so much to a small child—refuge from the world and a place to lay their head next to a parent’s heart • Beach Blanket To-Go: Repurpose old sheets to create the perfect picnic blanket for special outdoor meals • Cozy Wall Pockets: A creative solution for storing a child’s small treasures Pattern templates for Handmade Home', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '192', '2009-08-11', '5', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QKiiHrybi0MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Handmade Home')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

As an epidemic, obesity threatens to weaken the health, economy, and might of the most powerful nation in the world. In Killer Fat, Natalie Boero examines how and why obesity emerged as a major public health concern and national obsession in recent years. Using primary sources and in-depth interviews, Boero enters the world of bariatric surgeries, Weight Watchers, and Overeaters Anonymous to show how common expectations of what bodies are supposed to look like help to determine what sorts of interventions and policies are considered urgent in containing this new kind of disease. Boero argues that obesity, like the traditional epidemics of biological contagion and mass death, now incites panic, a doomsday scenario that must be confronted in a struggle for social stability. The “war” on obesity, she concludes, is a form of social control.

From international, multibillion-dollar financial transactions to top-secret government communications, all would be vulnerable to the secret-code-breaking ability of the quantum computer. Written by a renowned quantum physicist closely involved in the U.S. government’s development of quantum information science, Schrödinger’s Killer App: Race to Build the World’s First Quantum Computer presents an inside look at the government’s quest to build a quantum computer capable of solving complex mathematical problems and hacking the public-key encryption codes used to secure the Internet. The "killer application" refers to Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm, which would unveil the encrypted communications of the entire Internet if a quantum computer could be built to run the algorithm. Schrödinger’s notion of quantum entanglement—and his infamous cat—is at the heart of it all. The book develops the concept of entanglement in the historical context of Einstein’s 30-year battle with the physics community over the true meaning of quantum theory. It discusses the remedy to the threat posed by the quantum code breaker: quantum cryptography, which is unbreakable even by the quantum computer. The author also covers applications to other important areas, such as quantum physics simulators, synchronized clocks, quantum search engines, quantum sensors, and imaging devices. In addition, he takes readers on a philosophical journey that considers the future ramifications of quantum technologies. Interspersed with amusing and personal anecdotes, this book presents quantum computing and the closely connected foundations of quantum mechanics in an engaging manner accessible to non-specialists.

Simpson provides an original and broad overview of the evolving serial killer genre in the two media most responsible for its popularity: literature and cinema of the 1980s and 1990s. The fictional serial killer, with a motiveless, highly individualized modus operandi, is the latest manifestation of the multiple murderers and homicidal maniacs that haunt American literature and, particularly, visual media such as cinema and television. Simpson theorizes that the serial killer genre results from a combination of earlier genre depictions of multiple murderers, inherited Gothic storytelling conventions, and threatening folkloric figures reworked over the years into a contemporary mythology of violence. Updated and repackaged for mass consumption, the Gothic villains, the monsters, the vampires, and the werewolves of the past have evolved into the fictional serial killer, who clearly reflects American cultural anxieties at the start of the twenty-first century. Citing numerous sources, Simpson argues that serial killers’ recent popularity as genre monsters owes much to their pliability to any number of authorial ideological agendas from both the left and the right ends of the political spectrum. Serial killers in fiction are a kind of debased and traumatized visionary, whose murders privately and publicly re-empower them with a pseudo-divine aura in the contemporary political moment. The current fascination with serial killer narratives can thus be explained as the latest manifestation of the ongoing human fascination with tales of gruesome murders and mythic villains finding a receptive audience in a nation galvanized by the increasingly apocalyptic tension between the extremist philosophies of both the New Right and the anti-New Right. Faced with a blizzard of works of varying quality dealing with the serial killer, Simpson has ruled out the catalog approach in this study in favor of in-depth an analysis of the best American work in the genre. He has chosen novels and films that have at least some degree of public name-recognition or notoriety, including Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris, Manhunter directed by Michael Mann, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer directed by John McNaughton, Seven directed by David Fincher, Natural Born Killers directed by Oliver Stone, Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates, and American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis.', DEFAULT, '41.6', '244', '2000', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A3jK8xoAhk0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Psycho Paths')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Until the disturbances of April 2006 and subsequent deterioration in bilateral relations between Australia and Solomon Islands under the Sogavare government, experts had hailed the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) as an unqualified success. Some saw it as a model for ''cooperative intervention'' in ''failing states'' worldwide. Following these developments success seems less certain and aspects of the RAMSI model appear flawed. Using the case of Solomon Islands, this book raises fundamental questions about the nature of ''cooperative intervention'' as a vehicle for state building, asking whether it should be construed as a mainly technical endeavour or whether it is unavoidably a political undertaking with political consequences.

The book opens with a study of the capoeira “Bamba,” Mestre Bimba, who became renowned as a fighting champion in Bahia and opened the first legal academy during the dictatorship of Getulio Vargas. Taylor investigates the dramatic development of the schism that resulted in the competing styles of Regional and Angola. Moving into contemporary capoeira, the author provides an overview of new trends, such as international encounters, long distance “mail-order mestres,” mass membership capoeira associations, cyber-capoeira, and grading systems. The book features the wisdom of a number of important mestres recounting their experiences teaching capoeira professionally around the world.

A compilation of Angolan music is included in CD format. Marissa J. Moorman presents a social and cultural history of the relationship between Angolan culture and politics. She argues that it was in and through popular urban music, produced mainly in the musseques (urban shantytowns) of the capital city, Luanda, that Angolans forged the nation and developed expectations about nationalism. Through careful archival work and extensive interviews with musicians and those who attended performances in bars, community centers, and cinemas, Moorman explores the ways in which the urban poor imagined the nation. The spread of radio technology and the establishment of a recording industry in the early 1970s reterritorialized an urban-produced sound and cultural ethos by transporting music throughout the country. When the formerly exiled independent movements returned to Angola in 1975, they found a population receptive to their nationalist message but with different expectations about the promises of independence. In producing and consuming music, Angolans formed a new image of independence and nationalist politics.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '290', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XxtNa5hQmacC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Intonations')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Mobile wireless digital devices, including smartphones and tablets with seemingly limitless functionality, have brought about radical changes in our lives, providing hyper-connectivity to social networks and cloud computing. But the digital world has hardly pierced the medical cocoon. Until now. Beyond reading email and surfing the Web, we will soon be checking our vital signs on our phone. We can already continuously monitor our heart rhythm, blood glucose levels, and brain waves while we sleep. Miniature ultrasound imaging devices are replacing the icon of medicine--the stethoscope. DNA sequencing, Facebook, and the Watson supercomputer have already saved lives. For the first time we can capture all the relevant data from each individual to enable precision therapy, prevent major side effects of medications, and ultimately to prevent many diseases from ever occurring. And yet many of these digital medical innovations lie unused because of the medical community''s profound resistance to change. In The Creative Destruction of Medicine, Eric Topol--one of the nation''s top physicians and a leading voice on the digital revolution in medicine--argues that radical innovation and a true democratization of medical care are within reach, but only if we consumers demand it.

Even as he does that, a new challenge beckons: Krishna''s eternal soulmate has taken birth on the mortal plane to be with him, and no sooner does he find her than he realizes that she is being used as bait in a deadly trap.', DEFAULT, '6.99', '296', '2013-02-28', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mcTjAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Fortress Of Dwarka')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

To that end, this book and set of tools is organized around the premise that developers will have the following interests and needs: Visio Structure: An organized and comprehensive presentation of Visio''s document and user-interface object models including the all-important ShapeSheet. Browsable Reference Material: There''s lots of info in Visio''s Developer Help, but it will take you forever to digest enough of it to get the big picture. To greatly accelerate the process, this book includes a "browsable" reference section -- objects, properties, methods and shapesheet cells and functions tabulated in an order which brings related items together. You''ll still use Help, but with this book you can rapidly skim over and locate features of interest to your task at hand. Visio Behavior: The power beneath the surface. Work with it, not against it! Investigation of numerous key areas of Visio behavior, at a level which uncovers many subtleties not evident from simply using the product. Solution Architectures for adding functionality to Visio. Several alternative forms are possible. Read why "VSL Addons" are still the preferred form for many kinds of application. VSLs have traditionally required C/C++, Delphi, or some other language capable of working with Automation and producing arbitrary DLLs. Now, using the "VBVSL_Adapter" component available with this book, VSLs can be built easily with Visual Basic. The VBVSL foundation allows the book to use Visual Basic samples to illuminate many more topics of interest to Visio-based application-builders. Several sample applications are supplied which you can copy and modify to get your own addons up and running quickly. Browsing Tools: The book gives you access to download a suite of browsing tools which you can use to instantly clarify exactly what''s going with several of Visio''s more elaborate or arcane features, such as EventLists, UIObjects, CommandBars, browse Visio 2002''s new XML-format files and so on.

You will learn how the use of standard profiles allows Bluetooth devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other and work together in the same way.Bluetooth devices operate in the frequency band where other devices operate including wireless LAN, microwave ovens, cordless telephones, wireless video cameras, and others. This will explain how Bluetooth''s spread spectrum technology minimizes interference to and from other devices.Bluetooth was designed to be a simple low power radio link to primarily replace cables for short range connections. While the use of a simple design results in an efficient wireless communication device, it does mean that Bluetooth does not perform the same as other wireless technologies. You will discover in this book how Bluetooth compares to other technologies such as WLAN systems.Bluetooth has several user programmable options including the ability to hide devices (non-discoverable) and the ability to require other users to authenticate before allowing other devices to connect to your device.

Running on a coin-sized battery, BLE can operate reliably for years, connecting and extending everything from personal area network devices to next-generation sensors. Now, one of the standard’s leading developers has written the first comprehensive, accessible introduction to BLE for every system developer, designer, and engineer. Robin Heydon, a member of the Bluetooth SIG Hall of Fame, has brought together essential information previously scattered through multiple standards documents, sharing the context and expert insights needed to implement high-performance working systems. He first reviews BLE’s design goals, explaining how they drove key architectural decisions, and introduces BLE’s innovative usage models. Next, he thoroughly covers how the two main parts of BLE, the controller and host, work together, and then addresses key issues from security and profiles through testing and qualification. This knowledge has enabled the creation of Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready devices. This guide is an indispensable companion to the official BLE standards documents and is for every technical professional and decision-maker considering BLE, planning BLE products, or transforming plans into working systems. Topics Include BLE device types, design goals, terminology, and core concepts Architecture: controller, host, applications, and stack splits Usage models: presence detection, data broadcasting, connectionless models, and gateways Physical Layer: modulation, frequency band, radio channels, power, tolerance, and range Direct Test Mode: transceiver testing, hardware interfaces, and HCI Link Layer: state machine, packets, channels, broadcasting, encryption, and optimization HCI: physical/logical interfaces, controller setup, and connection management L2CAP: channels and packet structure, and LE signaling channels Attributes: grouping, services, characteristics, and protocols Security: pairing, bonding, and data signing Generic Access Profiles: roles, modes, procedures, security modes, data advertising, and services Applications, devices, services, profiles, and peripherals Testing/qualification: starting projects, selecting features, planning, testing, compliance, and more', DEFAULT, '37.67', '368', '2012-10-26', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=aDReS05LxNoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Bluetooth Low Energy')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

One of the biggest steps forward is the standardization of Java APIs for Bluetooth wireless technology (JABWT). The latest updates to this standard is explained in detail in this book. The JABWT standard, defined by the JSR-82 Java Specification Request, supports rapid development of Bluetooth applications that are portable, secure, and highly-usable. Wireless device manufacturers have responded overwhelmingly to the JABWT specification by implementing JABWT applications in mobile phones and other personal wireless communications products. "Bluetooth Application Programming Essentials: Programming with the Java APIs" explains in detail how to write Bluetooth applications using the Java APIs to exploit the power of both technologies. Written by the specification lead for JSR-82 and two other key participants in developing the standards of JABWT, this book provides the authoritative explanations and concrete examples needed to get started right away. This book provides embedded Java developers with to-the-point information on the APIs in the specification with detailed programmatic examples of the APIs in use. A NEW chapter on the Push Registry definition (a new feature in the 1.1 version of JSR-82) has been added. Finally, the new Essentials version of the book will update the remaining chapters to reflect changes in the latest Bluetooth spec (2.1) and the industry as a whole. As a bonus, this edition of the book offers over 200 pages of added content on the website. This "bonus material" includes complete source code from examples in the book, the javex.bluetooth code package, the java.obex code package, an enhanced set of "Example Applications", and a tutorial on "Implementing JABWT on a Device."

Determined to clone an endangered flower—the rare ghost orchid Polyrrhiza lindenii—a deeply eccentric and oddly attractive man named John Laroche leads Orlean on an unforgettable tour of America’s strange flower-selling subculture, through Florida’s swamps and beyond, along with the Seminoles who help him and the forces of justice who fight him. In the end, Orlean—and the reader—will have more respect for underdog determination and a powerful new definition of passion. In this new edition, coming fifteen years after its initial publication and twenty years after she first met the “orchid thief,” Orlean revisits this unforgettable world, and the route by which it was brought to the screen in the film Adaptation, in a new retrospective essay.

This book shows you how Google Chrome browser extensions are extremely useful tools for enhancing the functionality of the Google Chrome web browser. For example, you can create extensions to summarize the current page you are reading, or to save all of the images in the page you are browsing. They have access to almost all of the features provided by the Google Chrome browser, and they can encapsulate such features in the form of a bundled application providing targeted functionality to users. Extensions also run in a sandboxed environment, making them secure – which is a huge plus in the modern web! The APIs provided by the Chrome Extensions framework help you empower web applications by coupling them with amazing features provided by the Google Chrome web browser, such as bookmarks, history, tabs, actions, storage, notifications, search, and a lot more – facilitating increased productivity on the Google Chrome web browser. What You Will Learn: Transform your web application ideas into Google Chrome Extensions. Choose the recommended components for creating your kind of extension. Leverage the power of a Google Chrome browser by making use of the extensions API. Showcase your existing web-development skills in a modern way by creating useful extensions.

This in-depth tutorial goes beyond what is available anywhere else to teach how to write WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to handle events and asynchronous method calls. Reactive programming allows you to turn those aspects of your code that are currently imperative into something much more event-driven and flexible. For this reason, it’s sometimes referred to as LINQ for Events. Reactive programming hinges on the concept of the observable collection, as opposed to the simple enumerable collection with which we’re all familiar. For example, to extract data from a collection and add it to a list box, you would traditionally iterate through the list box, extracting each object in turn. This approach works fine, but it requires significant knowledge about the data you’re working with, which can be limiting. In Rx programming, you''re instead informed about each object in turn and then free to react to each notification however you like, which affords much greater flexibility. This book shows you how reactive programming can be applied to a range of situations—from WPF applications to Windows Phone apps—to improve coding efficiency and boost performance. What you’ll learn How to create, debug and manage reactive extensions in many situations The observer pattern and how it can be applied to your projects How to avoid spaghetti code by using Rx to manage your asynchronous methods How to use SelectMany to explore the heart of the Reactive Extensions How to come to grips with the reactive user interface framework for building both small and large applications Who this book is for This book will be most beneficial to existing .NET developers with a grounding in WPF, Silverlight and C#, who want to take their skills further using the powerful reactive programming approach.

Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, including longtime friend Ed Ricketts, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Dora, Mack and his boys, Lee Chong, and the other characters in this world where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In her introduction, Susan Shillinglaw shows how the novel expresses, both in style and theme, much that is essentially Steinbeck: “scientific detachment, empathy toward the lonely and depressed…and, at the darkest level…the terror of isolation and nothingness.” For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Just completing her freshman year at Callister University, Emily faces a quiet summer in the city slums, supporting herself by working at the campus library. During one of her jogs through the nearby cemetery while visiting her brother Bill’s grave, Emily witnesses a brutal killing—and then she blacks out. When Emily regains consciousness, she realizes she’s been kidnapped by a young crime boss and his gang. She is hurled into a secret underworld, wondering why she is still alive and for how long. Held captive in rural Vermont, she tries to make sense of her situation and what it means. While uncovering secrets about her brother and his untimely death, Emily falls in love with her very rich and very dangerous captor, twenty-six-year-old Cameron. She understands it’s a forbidden love and one that won’t allow her to return to her previous life.

From the woman who has reported on every president from Kennedy to Clinton for United Press International: a unique glimpse into the White House -- and a telling record of the ever-changing relationship between the presidency and the press. From her earliest years, Helen Thomas wanted to be a reporter. Raised in Depression-era Detroit, she worked her way to Washington after college and, unlike other women reporters who gave up their jobs to returning veterans, parlayed her copy-aide job at the Washington Daily News into a twelve-year stint as a radio news writer for UPI, covering such beats as the Department of Justice and other federal agencies. Assigned to the White House press corps in 1961, Thomas was the first woman to close a press conference with "Thank you, Mr. President," and has covered every administration since Kennedy''s. Along the way, she was among the pioneers who broke down barriers against women in the national media, becoming the first female president of the White House Correspondents Association, the first female officer of the National Press Club and the first woman member, later president, of the Gridiron Club. In this revealing memoir, which includes hundreds of anecdotes, insights, observations, and personal details, Thomas looks back at a career spent with presidents at home and abroad, on the ground and in the air. She evaluates the enormous changes that Watergate brought, including diminished press access to the Oval Office, and how they have affected every president since Nixon. Providing a unique view of the past four decades of presidential history, Front Row at the White House offers a seasoned study of the relationship between the chief executive officer and the press -- a relationship that is sometimes uneasy, sometimes playful, yet always integral to democracy. "Soon enough there will be another president, another first lady, another press secretary and a whole new administration to discover.

Based on crack initiation criteria, CZMs can be categorized into two groups, i.e., intrinsic and extrinsic. This study focuses on extrinsic CZMs, which eliminates many of the inherent drawbacks present in the intrinsic CZMs. The extrinsic CZM approach allows spontaneous and adaptive insertion of arbitrary cracks in space and time, i.e., where needed and when needed. To that effect, a novel topology-based data structure is employed in the study, which provides both versatility and robustness, and allows adaptive insertion of cohesive elements as required by simulation. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems are analyzed. A series of dynamic fracture phenomena, including spontaneous crack initiation, dynamic crack micro-branching and crack competition, are successfully captured by the CZM simulations.

Most of them were low paid textile workers who had been ordered to return to their cramped workshops the day after ominous cracks were discovered in the building''s concrete structure. Rana Plaza''s destruction revealed a stark tragedy in the making: of men (in fact mostly women and children) toiling in fragile, flammable buildings who provide the world with limitless cheap garments - through Walmart, Benetton and Gap - and bring in 70% of Bangladesh''s foreign exchange. In elegiac prose, Jeremy Seabrook investigates the disproportionate sacrifices demanded by the manufacture of such throwaway items as baseball caps and sweatshirts. He also traces the intertwined histories of workers in what is now Bangladesh, and Lancashire. Two hundred years ago the former were dispossessed of ancient skills and their counterparts in Lancashire forced into labour settlements; in a ghostly replay of traffic in the other direction, the decline of Britain''s textile industry coincided with Bangladesh becoming one of the world''s major clothing exporters. The two examples offer mirror images of impoverishment and affluence. With capital becoming more protean than ever, it won''t be long before global business, in its nomadic cultivation of profit, relocates mass textile manufacture to an even cheaper source of labour than Bangladesh, with all too predictable consequences for those involved.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '288', '2015-01-10', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=tV9eCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Song of the Shirt')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Lively and thought-provoking, Universe on a T-Shirt tells the fascinating story of the search for the Holy Grail of physics. Dan Falk places this intriguing story in its historical context, tracing the quest from ancient Greece to the breakthroughs of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein, to the excitement over string theory and today’s efforts to merge quantum theory with general relativity. With as much emphasis on history as on science, Falk’s accessible approach is ideal for anyone intrigued by the advances in modern physics but still wondering what theoretical physicists are searching for, and why. Today’s physicists use sophisticated methods, but their goal—the search for simplicity—has not changed since the time of the ancient Greeks. Universe on a T-Shirt is filled with quirky personalities, brilliant minds, and bold ideas—high science and high drama. "An admirably concise and comprehensive overview of cosmology . . .

Ward develop the terminology and set forth the economic theory of commodity advertising, as well as the legal and industrial structures necessary to underwriting commodity programs. Forker and Ward offer methods for evaluating the economic effectiveness of commodity programs, suggest techniques for integrating advertising and promotion expenditures into demand analysis, and propose a new method for estimating the functional relationship between advertising expenditures and expected sales response - one that provides a more realistic estimate of the shape of the advertising response function. They also present case studies on the advertising programs for fluid milk, beef, apples, citrus, wool, fresh tomato, catfish, potatoes, soybean, cheese, and fats and oils. Commodity Advertising demonstrates that like their brand counterparts, generic advertising programs do have a positive impact on consumer demand. While the impact varies among commodity groups, research indicates that well planned and executed generic advertising can yield benefits to the producers who fund the programs as well as the processors and consumers of the commodity. The authors treat advertising as information, and they present methods to estimate the value of this information to consumers and to the commodity industry. In general, advertising yields greater benefits to the producers of the commodity when the industry''s supply response is inelastic. But many other factors, including product quality, funding base, pricing, available substitutes, and consumer preferences influence the ability of commodity advertising programs to be effective. The authors discuss the influence on commodity demand of all these factors.

Ms. Quinlan''s case contained nearly all the elements of the problems we still face: vague, general, but sincere prior oral statements suggesting that she would not want continued treatment; a family attempting to do what they saw as best for her; and physicians uncertain whether to use medical judgment alone (and if so, what the "right" medical decision was), to preserve her life at all costs, or to honor the family''s interpretation of their daughter''s choice. Most ironically, once she was removed from her respirator, she did not die.

Patients now legally can write advance directives to govern their treatment decisions at a time of future incapacity, yet in clinical practice their wishes often are ignored. Examining the tension between incompetent patients'' prior wishes and their current best interests as well as other challenges to advance directives, Robert S. Olick offers a comprehensive argument for favoring advance instructions during the dying process. He clarifies widespread confusion about the moral and legal weight of advance directives, and he prescribes changes in law, policy, and practice that would not only ensure that directives count in the care of the dying but also would define narrow instances when directives should not be followed. Olick also presents and develops an original theory of prospective autonomy that recasts and strengthens patient and family control. While focusing largely on philosophical issues the book devotes substantial attention to legal and policy questions and includes case studies throughout. An important resource for medical ethicists, lawyers, physicians, nurses, health care professionals, and patients'' rights advocates, it champions the practical, ethical, and humane duty of taking advance directives seriously where it matters most-at the bedside of dying patients.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '248', '2001-07-18', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AcIpW6sysS4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Taking Advance Directives Seriously')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

A patient''s right to self-determination becomes a poignant and volatile issue in the context of modern life-sustaining technologies. When the benefit of medical treatment is overshadowed by the resulting burdens, treatment may ethically be withdrawn. Patients have the right to make this decision, assuming they still have the capacity to make it. Through advance directives a competent patient can extend his right to consent to or refuse medical treatment indefinitely into the future. Whether in the form of informal oral instructions or formal written documents, advance directives insure patients that their treatment wishes will be carried out. They also alleviate the uncertainty, guilt, and/or fear of legal consequences facing the family and caregivers. This volume is a collection of fourteen essays investigating the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of directives, the role of professionals in making and honoring them, policy issues that need to be addressed, and future directions which directives may take. Although such documents may be used to request treatment, this volume limits its focus to their more common function . . . the refusal of treatment. Timely and comprehensive, Advance Directives in Medicine provides a stimulating overview of this relevant topic. The papers in this volume were originally presented at a multidisciplinary conference on advance directives. Revised and edited for this text, they address a variety of questions and issues, for instance: What are the individual and societal benefits of advance directives? Does an advance directive tamper with the sanctity of life? Will normalizing directives have an adverse effect on the practice of medicine? Should a patient specify treatments to be withheld within a directive, such as the use of CPR, nutrition, or hydration? What legal sanctions should apply against those who ignore directives?

Throughout the course of the war, more than 2000 men were members of MosbyÕs command, some for only a short time. Mosby had few confidants (he was described by one acquaintance as Òa disturbing companionÓ) but became close friends with one of his finest officers, Samuel Forrer Chapman. Chapman served with Mosby for more than two years, and their friendship continued in the decades after the war. Take Sides with the Truth is a collection of more than eighty letters, published for the first time in their entirety, written by Mosby to Chapman from 1880, when Mosby was made U.S. consul to Hong Kong, until his death in a Washington, D.C., hospital in 1916. These letters reveal much about MosbyÕs character and present his innermost thoughts on many subjects. At times, MosbyÕs letters show a man with a sensitive nature; however, he could also be sarcastic and freely derided individuals he did not like. His letters are critical of General Robert E. LeeÕs staff officers (Òthere was a lying concert between themÓ) and trace his decades-long crusade to clear the name of his friend and mentor J. E. B. Stuart in the Gettysburg campaign. Mosby also continuously asserts his belief that slavery was the cause of the Civil WarÑa view completely contrary to a major portion of the Lost Cause ideology. For him, it was more important to Òtake sides with the TruthÓ than to hold popular opinions. Peter A.

Politics, religion, philosophy and personal ambition: all have played roles in this drama. There are poignant personal stories, of people like Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Herschel, and Hubble. Today scientists are attempting to determine the distance to objects near the borders of the observable universe, far beyond anything that can be seen with the naked eye in the night sky, and to measure time back to its origin.

Is the technological ability to multitask further compressing time in our already hurried existence?The authors consider the rise of a mobile youth culture based on peer-to-peer networks, with its own language of texting, and its own values. They examine the phenomenon of flash mobs, and the possible political implications. And they look at the relationship between communication and development and the possibility that developing countries could "leapfrog" directly to wireless and satellite technology.

So she has turned to the prophet Daniel for help. The Daniel Prayer is born deep within your soul, erupts through your heart, and pours out on your lips - words created by and infused with the Spirit of God, quivering with spiritual electricity. It''s really not an everyday type of prayer. It''s a prayer birthed under pressure, sometimes heartache or grief. It can be triggered by a sudden revelation of hope: an answer to prayer, a promise freshly received, a miracle that lies just over the horizon... This book will help you to pray - effectively - for your nation, for your family, and for yourself. In it, Anne answers such questions as... Does God only hear the prayers of good people? How do I know the God to whom I pray will listen? How do I know God cares about my prayer? How do I know God will answer my prayer? Why should I pray at all? Does it matter where I am when I pray? Are words in prayer all that matter, or does my attitude affect prayer? And most crucial of all - what difference does my prayer actually make?

Are you 30, 60, or even 90 days late on several accounts? If so, you aren’t alone. According to a January 2010 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, there are 609.8 million credit cards held by U.S. consumers, and the average credit card debt per household is $15,519. In the last 12 months, 15 percent of American adults, or nearly 34 million people, have been late making a credit card payment, and 8 percent (18 million people) have missed a payment entirely, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. If these statistics hit home for you, don’t turn to bankruptcy to solve your financial woes. This book will provide you with the tools to legally settle your credit card accounts — without ruining your financial situation for years to come. How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar is for everyone who is unable to pay mounting minimum payments on their credit cards. You will learn everything you need to know about the basics of credit card debt, including interest rates, finance charges, minimum payments, and late fees. Discover what actually happens to your credit when you are late making your payments or stop making payments altogether and how long it takes before your credit cards debt is sold to a collection agency. This book will provide tips and strategies for negotiating with your original creditor and collection agencies and sample settlement letters you can use when working with creditors. Equip yourself with proven strategies for legally challenging the validity of your credit card debt and information on how to determine whether your rights are being violated under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You will find out the advantages of not filing bankruptcy and how to work with credit counselors and avoid debt-reduction scams. Once you have successfully settled your debt and avoided bankruptcy, you will learn how to avoid repeating these mistakes in the future by setting budgets, cutting costs, and lowering interest rates. Learn how the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which went into effect in February 2010, affects you as a consumer. While these new rules do not absolve consumers of their obligations, they do mean that credit card companies can no longer retroactively increase rates, charge misleading late fees, or use over-limit fee traps. We have spent hundreds of hours interviewing top financial experts, bill collectors, and individuals just like you who were able to legally settle their credit card debt without resorting to bankruptcy. If you are tired of dodging phone calls from collectors or worrying about how missed payments have ruined your credit score, get yourself back to a more stable financial situation — one where credit card debt is a thing of the past.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '288', '2010', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5lUh_vDLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Massie''s Catherine the Great. In a work of extraordinary narrative power, filled with brilliant personalities and vivid scenes of dramatic action, Robert K. Massie, the Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Peter the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, and Dreadnought, elevates to its proper historical importance the role of sea power in the winning of the Great War. The predominant image of this first world war is of mud and trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, poison gas, and slaughter. A generation of European manhood was massacred, and a wound was inflicted on European civilization that required the remainder of the twentieth century to heal. But with all its sacrifice, trench warfare did not win the war for one side or lose it for the other. Over the course of four years, the lines on the Western Front moved scarcely at all; attempts to break through led only to the lengthening of the already unbearably long casualty lists. For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts—gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away—were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to “seize the trident” by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry. Castles of Steel is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K.

This edition includes a new chapter on Japan and all-new illustrations drawn from the television series. Until around 11,000 BC, all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, and genocide. The paths that lead from scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies arise? Why weren''t native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories tracing societal differences to biological differences. He assembles convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of discovery. In its sweep, Guns, Germs and Steel encompasses the rise of agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of dinosaurs and glaciers.

For the true story of military upheaval, we must look to the sea. On the eve of the war in August 1914, Great Britain and Germany possessed the two greatest navies the world had ever seen. When war came, these two fleets of dreadnoughts—gigantic floating castles of steel able to hurl massive shells at an enemy miles away—were ready to test their terrible power against each other. Their struggles took place in the North Sea and the Pacific, at the Falkland Islands and the Dardanelles. They reached their climax when Germany, suffocated by an implacable naval blockade, decided to strike against the British ring of steel. The result was Jutland, a titanic clash of fifty-eight dreadnoughts, each the home of a thousand men. When the German High Seas Fleet retreated, the kaiser unleashed unrestricted U-boat warfare, which, in its indiscriminate violence, brought a reluctant America into the war. In this way, the German effort to “seize the trident” by defeating the British navy led to the fall of the German empire. Ultimately, the distinguishing feature of Castles of Steel is the author himself. The knowledge, understanding, and literary power Massie brings to this story are unparalleled. His portrayals of Winston Churchill, the British admirals Fisher, Jellicoe, and Beatty, and the Germans Scheer, Hipper, and Tirpitz are stunning in their veracity and artistry. Castles of Steel is about war at sea, leadership and command, courage, genius, and folly. All these elements are given magnificent scope by Robert K. Massie’ s special and widely hailed literary mastery.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '880', '2003-10-28', '7', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LUSXbXK-Ue8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Castles of Steel')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This edition includes a new chapter on Japan and all-new illustrations drawn from the television series. Until around 11,000 BC, all peoples were still Stone Age hunter/gatherers. At that point, a great divide occurred in the rates that human societies evolved. In Eurasia, parts of the Americas, and Africa, farming became the prevailing mode of existence when indigenous wild plants and animals were domesticated by prehistoric planters and herders. As Jared Diamond vividly reveals, the very people who gained a head start in producing food would collide with preliterate cultures, shaping the modern world through conquest, displacement, and genocide. The paths that lead from scattered centers of food to broad bands of settlement had a great deal to do with climate and geography. But how did differences in societies arise? Why weren''t native Australians, Americans, or Africans the ones to colonize Europe? Diamond dismantles pernicious racial theories tracing societal differences to biological differences. He assembles convincing evidence linking germs to domestication of animals, germs that Eurasians then spread in epidemic proportions in their voyages of discovery. In its sweep, Guns, Germs and Steel encompasses the rise of agriculture, technology, writing, government, and religion, providing a unifying theory of human history as intriguing as the histories of dinosaurs and glaciers.

Hood "Abrahams and Zhang''s timely treatise is a must-read for all those interested in the critical role of credit in the economy. They ably explore the intersection of credit access and credit risk, suggesting a hybrid approach of human judgment and computer models as the necessary path to balanced and fair lending. In an environment of rapidly changing consumer demographics, as well as regulatory reform initiatives, this book suggests new analytical models by which to provide credit to ensure compliance and to manage enterprise risk." --Frank A.

Not only do Abrahams and Zhang adeptly articulate why we can and should improve our systems, they provide the analytic evidence, and the steps toward implementations.

For Powers, science is something more than the accumulation of technical data and the proliferation of theories developed to explain physical phenomena. It is an evolving body of knowledge which has important insights to contribute into the conditions which ground human experience The close and often detailed discussions of contemporary issues in science which Powers incorporates into his fiction indicate the extent to which he sees science as an inseparable component in any attempt to understand the complexities of human experience. The common ground Powers uses to link the interests of science and those of fiction into a balanced, if not always harmonious, pursuit of truth is wonder. The limitations placed on science during this century do not undermine the ability of science to influence what we can know. Nor do these limitations diminish the ability of science to inspire wonder. Quite the opposite. For Powers the true wonder of the human intellect rests in our remarkable ability to balance observation and interpretation. What he discovers again and again in his fiction is that science, like literature, is a product of the human imagination, a way to mediate between the world and our perceptions of it. The recognition that science is a cultural practice--a body of knowledge thoroughly imbued with the practices and prejudices of its historical surroundings--is a necessary first step in mending the rift separating science and literature, head and heart. The greatest insight of twentieth century science may just be the recognition that there are other ways to access the truth. Richard Powers skillful weaving of science and art is a testament that literature offers a unique vantage point from which we might learn something of value about ourselves and the world we inhabit.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '208', '2007-02-22', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NBkRtT0fQ8AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Synthesizing Systems')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

As a member of the Toronto Police Service Hold-Up Squad, Jack is tired of always having to clean up after the fact. When the blueprints of a robbery that has yet to take place land on his desk, there''s only one problem...he can''t read a word of them. The details of the heist are contained on a computer hard drive, protected by an unbreakable security code, seized in an explosive police raid on a suspected gunrunner. Katherine Sharpe, beautiful, brilliant and ambitious, is the head of a cutting-edge computer research firm on the verge of introducing an earth-shattering technological breakthrough, something she’s been working on her whole adult life. But Theodore Sumner, the Chairman of the Board and her nemesis at ComTech, has other ideas. When he threatens to bring her dreams crashing down around her, Katherine sets in motion a plan to stop him that quickly spirals out of control. Now, as their worlds collide, Jack has to rely on two unlikely partners, old-fashioned legwork, and the ability of a thirteen-year-old hacker to help help him solve the most difficult puzzle of his life... before Katherine’s Plan destroys them all.

Once the range equation is available, the book attacks the meaning of each term in it, moving through antennas, detection and tracking, radar cross-section, waveforms and signal processing, and systems applications. At the finish, the reader should be able to do an acceptable, first-order radar design, and to critique the designs of others. Students, engineers, scientists, and managers will benefit from this book. New to this edition: Every section of each chapter was revised in some way. The more noticeable enhancements are the additions of equation numbers, more numerical examples, table and figures showing many of the concepts numerically, and exercises for almost all the concepts. These enhancements make the book easier to learn from (and teach out of). Key Features of the Book Concise, self-contained chapters for quick and easy comprehension of concepts. A practical glossary to help readers look up and apply key radar terms. The 294 pages include 97 figures, 6 tables, 253 equations, and 61 exercises.

It focusses upon how soft law fits into the Community legal system, and how it is used, and, in particular, how it relates to Community legislation.Differentiation of the Community instruments, including the instruments of soft law, is often thought to enhance the effectiveness, legitimacy and transparency of the Community. This book asks whether soft law indeed provides a satisfactory alternative to legislation from this perspective and, if so, in what cases and under what conditions. Furthermore, the author asks to what extent the use of soft law implies good governance, and throws fresh light on this very heterogenous phenomenon, by looking at frequently used instruments in many different areas of Community law, such as competition law, state aid, environment, social policy etc., in the process identifying their different characteristics, aims, functions and legal effects. What emerges is that the conditions under which soft law is used may be problematic in relation to increasing the legitimacy, effectiveness and transparency of Community action.This is a work which will interest legal practitioners confronted with the use of soft law and the question of its possible legal effect in an increasing number of sectors and academics interested in the vexed question of how the increased use of soft law can be justified in a Community legal order built upon the rule of law. It is also critical of developments taking place within the framework of the European Convention and the proposed European Constitution, and goes beyond the immediate problems of soft law to touch upon issues such as competence, legal protection, division of powers between the EC and the Member States, institutional balance, lawmaking by the Community Courts, the scope of Community legal principles and the influence of soft law on the progressive development of both Community and national law.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '533', '2004', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B9Z82q_LXzwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Soft Law in European Community Law')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It is now used frequently—and often incorrectly—by political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power—the ability to coerce—grows out of a country''s military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country''s culture, political ideals, and policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration''s new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America''s military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states.

Considering recent autoethnographies of Afghan women, refugee testimony from Middle Eastern war zones, Jean Sasson’s bestsellers about the lives of Arab women, Norma Khouri’s fraudulent memoir Honor Lost, personal accounts by journalists reporting the war in Iraq, Satrapi’s Persepolis, Nafisi’s book, and Pax’s blog, Whitlock explores the contradictions and ambiguities in the rapid commodification of life memoirs.

In China, soft power has become one of the most frequently used phrases among political leaders, leading academics, and journalists. Defined against hard power, which often involves threat and coercion, soft power applies attraction, persuasion, and cooperation, finding its sources in culture, political values, and foreign policies. China, rich in culture and traditional philosophy, boasts abundant sources of soft power. Soft Power attempts to analyze the domestic and international views of China''s soft power, the main strengths and weaknesses of China''s soft power, and the application of soft power in China''s international politics. It provides a comprehensive exploration of the soft power dimension in China''s foreign relations by integrating views from various disciplines, such as history, education, culture, political economy, comparative politics, and philosophy. The book argues that soft power has become a very popular concept in China, that China is contemplating and exploring an innovative strategy in its rise and international politics, and that there have been quite a few notable elements of this in China''s diplomatic practice, including softer rhetoric, promotion of the Chinese culture abroad, economic diplomacy, and image building.

Rarely, if ever, are they cast as independent variables that can inform the behavior of regulators and market participants alike. This book explains how international financial law ''works'' - and presents an alternative theory for understanding its purpose, operation and limitations.

Mikicic dispels common misconceptions about theism and atheism and provides simple and straightforward answers to questions like: Is the U.S. a Christian nation? What are the differences between faith and reason? What are the benefits and drawbacks of religion? What are the arguments for and against theism? How accurate is the Bible? Who was Jesus?

Whereas kinematically redundant manipulators possess increased dexterity, compared to conventional non-redundant manipulators, their inverse kinematics is not unique and requires further treatment.

The residuals are compressed using JPEG 2000 Part 1 by bypassing the wavelet transform, which means that only the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) is used. In addition to controlling the MAE, techniques that minimize the MAE when a bit rate is specified are also described and tested. The proposed algorithms use JPEG 2000 for both, lossy compression of the original data and lossless residual coding. Due to the use of these two compression steps, the overall compression (total bit rate) is a function of two variables, the lossy bit rate and the lossless residual bit rate. For the case of controlling the MAE, two methods that search for the lowest total bit rate based on information obtained at two pivot points (lossy bit rates) are proposed. The results obtained using these techniques are compared with those acquired utilizing an exhaustive search. It will be shown that the pivot-based algorithms yield similar results obtained by using the exhaustive search. For the case of minimizing the MAE when a bit rate is specified, two techniques are developed and tested. The use of the JPEG 2000 quality scalability property is analyzed with regards to solving this same problem. This technique requires some form of bit allocation for the case of 3D data sets. Analysis and results for the methods that minimize the MAE are also included.

Once the range equation is available, the book attacks the meaning of each term in it, moving through antennas, detection and tracking, radar cross-section, waveforms and signal processing, and systems applications. At the finish, the reader should be able to do an acceptable, first-order radar design, and to critique the designs of others. Students, engineers, scientists, and managers will benefit from this book. New to this edition: Every section of each chapter was revised in some way. The more noticeable enhancements are the additions of equation numbers, more numerical examples, table and figures showing many of the concepts numerically, and exercises for almost all the concepts. These enhancements make the book easier to learn from (and teach out of). Key Features of the Book Concise, self-contained chapters for quick and easy comprehension of concepts. A practical glossary to help readers look up and apply key radar terms. The 294 pages include 97 figures, 6 tables, 253 equations, and 61 exercises.

To this end, several realistic control design examples from teaching-laboratory experiments, such as a two-wheeled, self-balancing robot, to complex systems like a flexible-link manipulator are given detailed presentation. All of these exercises are conducted using MATLAB® Robust Control Toolbox 3, Control System Toolbox and Simulink®. By sharing their experiences in industrial cases with minimum recourse to complicated theories and formulae, the authors convey essential ideas and useful insights into robust industrial control systems design using major H-infinity optimization and related methods allowing readers quickly to move on with their own challenges. The hands-on tutorial style of this text rests on an abundance of examples and features for the second edition: • rewritten and simplified presentation of theoretical and methodological material including original coverage of linear matrix inequalities; • new Part II forming a tutorial on Robust Control Toolbox 3; • fresh design problems including the control of a two-rotor dynamic system; and • end-of-chapter exercises. Electronic supplements to the written text that can be downloaded from extras.springer.com/isbn include: • M-files developed with MATLAB® help in understanding the essence of robust control system design portrayed in text-based examples; • MDL-files for simulation of open- and closed-loop systems in Simulink®; and • a solutions manual available free of charge to those adopting Robust Control Design with MATLAB® as a textbook for courses.

For such environments, we suggest the use of the robustness ap proach to decision making, which assumes inadequate knowledge of the decision maker about the random state of nature and develops a decision that hedges against the worst contingency that may arise. The main motivating factors for a decision maker to use the robustness approach are: • It does not ignore uncertainty and takes a proactive step in response to the fact that forecasted values of uncertain parameters will not occur in most environments; • It applies to decisions of unique, non-repetitive nature, which are common in many fast and dynamically changing environments; • It accounts for the risk averse nature of decision makers; and • It recognizes that even though decision environments are fraught with data uncertainties, decisions are evaluated ex post with the realized data. For all of the above reasons, robust decisions are dear to the heart of opera tional decision makers.

Robust optimization is designed to meet some major challenges associated with uncertainty-affected optimization problems: to operate under lack of full information on the nature of uncertainty; to model the problem in a form that can be solved efficiently; and to provide guarantees about the performance of the solution. The book starts with a relatively simple treatment of uncertain linear programming, proceeding with a deep analysis of the interconnections between the construction of appropriate uncertainty sets and the classical chance constraints (probabilistic) approach. It then develops the robust optimization theory for uncertain conic quadratic and semidefinite optimization problems and dynamic (multistage) problems.

Through them we have the opportunity to examine the origin, natural history, and ultimate extinction of not just a single species, but of an entire branch in the hominid fossil record. It is generally agreed that the human lineage can be traced back to this group of comparatively small-brained, large-toothed creatures. This volume focuses on the evolutionary history of these early hominids with state-of-the-art contributions by leading international authorities in the field. Although a case can be made for a "robust" lineage, the functional and taxonomic implications of the morphological features are subject to vigorous disagreement. An area of lively debate is the possible causal relationship between the presence of early Homo and the origin, evolution, and virtual extinction of "robust" australopithecines. This volume summarizes what has been learned about the evolutionary history of the "robust" australopithecines in the 50 years since Robert Broom first encountered the visage of a new kind of ape-man from Kromdraai. New discoveries from Kromdraai to Lomekwi have served to keep us aware that the paleontological record for hominid evolution is hardly exhausted. Because of such finds no single volume can hope to stand as a summary on the "robust" australopithecines for very long, but this classic volume comes close to achieving this goal. The book sheds new light upon some old questions and also acts to provide new questions. The answers to those questions bring us closer to a fuller understanding and appreciation of the origins, evolution, and ultimate demise of the "robust" australopithecines. Since the "robust" australopithecines most likely stand as our closest relatives, a better understanding of their origin, history, and demise serves to provide heightened appreciation of the course of human evolution itself. This definitive volume addresses the questions and problems surrounding this important lineage. Frederick E.

The authors introduce a new way to measure bypassing using the patients'' own knowledge of alternative health providers available to them instead of assuming that information as previously done. The authors analyze how perceived health care quality and prices impact patients'' bypassing decisions. The analysis uses data from a Quantitative Service Delivery Survey in Chad''s health sector carried out in 2004. The survey covers 281 primary health care centers and 1,801 patients. The matching of facility data and patient data allows the analysis to control for a wide range of important patient and facility characteristics, such as income, severity of illness, quality of health care, or price of services. The findings show that income inequalities translate into health service inequalities. There is evidence of two distinct types of bypassing activities in Chad: (1) patients from low-income households bypass high-quality facilities they cannot afford to go to low-quality facilities, and (2) rich individuals bypass low-quality facilities and aim for more expensive facilities that also offer a higher quality of care. These significant differences in patients'' facility choices are observed across income groups as well as between rural and urban areas.', DEFAULT, '0', '40', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lVKCcP-xA0sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Bypassing Health Providers: The Quest for Better Price and Quality of Health Care in Chad')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Considering these bodies of literature in conjunction with each other is important, as the ways that transgender activists push conversations around binary gender construction can serve as valuable model for activists concerned with addressing actual, lived realities outside of theory. Further, the challenges transgender bodies pose to both feminist and queer theories demonstrates the pressing need to constantly re-evaluate theories of sex and gender as they relate to embodied experiences. Ultimately, I will propose a new theoretical paradigm, a feminist politics of transgression, which will bring together the work of feminists, queer theorists, and transgender activists in the hopes of providing a platform for more effective collaboration.

Using brilliantly simple logic that illuminates the universal truths in common emotional challenges, Emotional Equations offers a way to identify the elements in our lives that we can change, those we can’t, and how to better understand our emotions so they can help us . . . rather than hurt us. Equations like “Despair = Suffering - Meaning” and “Happiness = Wanting What You Have ÷ Having What You Want” have been reviewed for mathematical and psychological accuracy by experts.

In SAP you can verify invoices against purchase orders and goods receipts. SAP provides important functionalities like automatic account determination, financial posting, etc. SAP is powerful software that can meet the needs of any business scenario for any type of business in any part of the world. Its all encompassing nature makes SAP complex. In order to derive maximum benefit for business, SAP must be understood well. Mr. Agrawal attempts to explain SAP completely; a seemingly impossible task. This is his third book on the Materials Management module; his first two books in the Materials Management module are ‘Purchasing’ and ‘Inventory Management’. In this book, like in his earlier books, he explains every screen of SAP MM Invoice Verification. Both the SAP Menu and Customizing Implementation Guide are expanded and the chapter number where they are covered is indicated. This not only creates a direct link between the book and the SAP software, but also ensures that the book is comprehensive. The author has taken care to balance details with overviews that explain linkages between concepts. The book is organized in chapters that are important business activities. Each chapter covers business processes carried out in SAP by the user as well as its related configuration. This book can be used to learn SAP from scratch; it is a learning guide. It is, therefore, useful to persons who are training to be SAP Consultants. Having learnt SAP with the help of this book, the Consultant keeps returning to refer to it. In implementation of SAP, Consultants prepare User Manual. With the availability of this book, their task becomes simpler. In the User Manual, they need to cover only implementation specific points. The user refers to this book as a generic User Manual. As the user gains knowledge he also begins to understand the customizing settings for his implementation. This book can also be used by Business Process Owners and Senior Managers to get an overview of SAP and the important choices it offers.', DEFAULT, '8.78', '620', '2014-12-29', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bYIlBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'SAP MM INVOICE VERIFICATION')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Adding to the confusion is the fact that it falls between two teams the MM team and the FI team and each assumes that the other is responsible for the design and configuration of Invoice Verification. Although the process can be streamlined, many organizations get the design and use of invoice verification wrong, resulting in vendors not being paid and accounts being placed on stop, which prevents further Purchase Orders from being processed until the vendor has been paid. The aim of this book is to help readers fully understand the invoice verification process, particularly the changes in ERP 6.0. If they get the design right, then the process will run smoothly and vendors will be paid on time (not too early either). User input can be kept to a minimum and much of the process can be automatic. There are one or two basic mistakes that are made during the design of the process and the guide highlights these (and many other confusing areas), and describes, in simple terms, the options available along with the consequences of getting it wrong. Stephen Birchall has more than 34 years of IT consulting experience and has spent the last 24 years as a SAP consultant. Stephen has expansive knowledge of SAP systems and modules, his primary area of expertise is SAP MM and AP processes. Stephen worked as a Lead Logistics Trainer at the SAP UK training center for 4 years, delivering a wide spectrum of SAP logistics courses including Invoice Verification / AP courses. In each of those 4 years 1995/6/7 and 8 SAP identified Stephen as the highest rated SAP trainer in the UK. While at the training center in the UK, Stephen single-handedly delivered the 5 week MM Academy ten times, back-to-back and loved every minute of it! Mr. Birchall was asked by SAP AG to write some additional exam questions for SAP''s MM exam. Stephen''s enthusiasm for SAP software is based on his first-hand experience of its capabilities on various projects at several major organizations, including several assignments for Deloitte, Accenture, SAP and HCL Axon.

Although much attention has been paid to the new technologies making this possible, from digitized books to sensor networks, it is the underlying social and policy changes that will have the most lasting effect on the scholarly enterprise. In Scholarship in the Digital Age, Christine Borgman explores the technical, social, legal, and economic aspects of the kind of infrastructure that we should be building for scholarly research in the twenty-first century.Borgman describes the roles that information technology plays at every stage in the life cycle of a research project and contrasts these new capabilities with the relatively stable system of scholarly communication, which remains based on publishing in journals, books, and conference proceedings. No framework for the impending "data deluge" exists comparable to that for publishing. Analyzing scholarly practices in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, Borgman compares each discipline''s approach to infrastructure issues. In the process, she challenges the many stakeholders in the scholarly infrastructure -- scholars, publishers, libraries, funding agencies, and others -- to look beyond their own domains to address the interaction of technical, legal, economic, social, political, and disciplinary concerns.

Feeds and feeding are the major variable operating costs in intensive aquaculture and the book is primarily in tended to aid decision making by fish farm managers in areas of feeding policy. The dramatic increases in aquaculture production seen over the past 15 years have been made possible, in large part, by gains in our understanding of the food and feed ing requirements of key fish and shrimp species. A global aquaculture feeds industry has developed and a wide range of specialist feeds is now sold. The new options in feeds and feeding systems, which are becoming available, necessitate continual review by farmers of their feeding policies, where choices must be made as to appropriate feed types and feeding methods.

Although historically, they are often considered to be the weak link in a system, particularly as the result of a number of unexpected catastrophic failures, new insight gained over the past twenty years by researchers around the world has shown that it is possible to select combinations of materials and design an engineered interface so that it is at least as strong as the surrounding materials. These new insights have been gained as a result of experimental study, numerical modeling and analytical investigation of successful and failed systems. While individual technical papers have been presented and/or published in various forums and proceedings over the years, no technical event has ever been convened for the sole purpose of allowing for exchange of information and ideas pertaining to geotechnical interfaces. The research symposium held in September 2008 in Atlanta Georgia, USA, in conjunction with the Fourth International Symposium on Deformation Characteristics of Geomaterials (IS Atlanta 2008) at the Georgia Institute of Technology on The Characterization and Behavior of Interfaces addressed this deficiency and the papers presented at that event are contained in this publication.

A bag of chips. That’s all sixteen-year-old Rashad is looking for at the corner bodega. What he finds instead is a fist-happy cop, Paul Galluzzo, who mistakes Rashad for a shoplifter, mistakes Rashad’s pleadings that he’s stolen nothing for belligerence, mistakes Rashad’s resistance to leave the bodega as resisting arrest, mistakes Rashad’s every flinch at every punch the cop throws as further resistance and refusal to STAY STILL as ordered. But how can you stay still when someone is pounding your face into the concrete pavement? But there were witnesses: Quinn Collins—a varsity basketball player and Rashad’s classmate who has been raised by Paul since his own father died in Afghanistan—and a video camera. Soon the beating is all over the news and Paul is getting threatened with accusations of prejudice and racial brutality. Quinn refuses to believe that the man who has basically been his savior could possibly be guilty. But then Rashad is absent. And absent again. And again. And the basketball team—half of whom are Rashad’s best friends—start to take sides. As does the school. And the town. Simmering tensions threaten to explode as Rashad and Quinn are forced to face decisions and consequences they had never considered before.

Excerpt: The United States dollar (sign: $; code: USD; also abbreviated US$), also referred to as the American dollar, is the official currency of the United States of America. It is divided into 100 smaller units called cents. The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is one of the world''s reserve currencies. Several countries use it as their official currency, in many others it is the de facto currency, and it is also used as the sole currency in some British Overseas Territories (Bermuda, British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos). The Constitution of the United States of America provides that the United States Congress shall have the power "To coin Money." Laws implementing this power are currently codified in Section 5112 of Title 31 of the United States Code. Section 5112 provides in which forms the United States dollars shall be issued. Those coins are both designated in Section 5112 as "legal tender" in payment of debts. The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar. The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle. Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins, which have values ranging from one cent to fifty dollars. These other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States dollar.

The residuals are compressed using JPEG 2000 Part 1 by bypassing the wavelet transform, which means that only the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) is used. In addition to controlling the MAE, techniques that minimize the MAE when a bit rate is specified are also described and tested. The proposed algorithms use JPEG 2000 for both, lossy compression of the original data and lossless residual coding. Due to the use of these two compression steps, the overall compression (total bit rate) is a function of two variables, the lossy bit rate and the lossless residual bit rate. For the case of controlling the MAE, two methods that search for the lowest total bit rate based on information obtained at two pivot points (lossy bit rates) are proposed. The results obtained using these techniques are compared with those acquired utilizing an exhaustive search. It will be shown that the pivot-based algorithms yield similar results obtained by using the exhaustive search. For the case of minimizing the MAE when a bit rate is specified, two techniques are developed and tested. The use of the JPEG 2000 quality scalability property is analyzed with regards to solving this same problem. This technique requires some form of bit allocation for the case of 3D data sets. Analysis and results for the methods that minimize the MAE are also included. It will be demonstrated that JPEG 2000 can be used to control the maximum absolute error using model-based techniques that omit the use of an exhaustive search.

In it he shares his most treasured memories and never-before-seen photographs as he looks back on an extraordinary life on and off the court. Hailed by many as the greatest coach in the history of American sports, John Wooden is as famous for his personal philosophy as he is for his career achievements. He inspired, guided, and motivated generations of fans with his bestselling books on leadership, values, family, and the true meaning of success. Coach Wooden wrote his final book, The Wisdom of Wooden: My Century On and Off the Court, in the last months before his death. Filled with his most treasured memories and more than 100 photographs, many never-before seen, it captures a life spent teaching, guiding, and serving others. Starting with his father’s now-famous 7 Point Creed—including “Make Each Day Your Masterpiece,” “Help Others,” and “Be True to Yourself,”—Coach Wooden affirms the principles to true success that helped him become an All American at Purdue University, a winning coach at Indiana State University, and an iconic sports figure at UCLA. Yet anyone who knows John Wooden knows his record on the court was only part of the story. In The Wisdom of Wooden the legendary coach offers readers a rare glimpse not just behind the scenes but inside the man; not just on the court but in the huddles; not just his maxims but his poems, those he wrote and those he loved; not just the people he inspired, but the family, friends, and fans who inspired him; not just the lessons he taught but the lessons he learned; not just what was on his mind but what was in his heart. Ultimately it was the life he lived that served as a model for his greatest lesson of all: a deep commitment to family, friends, and faith—the bedrock values of the man we all called, “Coach.” Praise for John Wooden “The Wisdom of Wooden has given me the life that I have . . . Thanks, Coach, for your faith and patience.” —Bill Walton “The Wisdom of Wooden is a lifetime of Coach Wooden’s ideas on how to live life without sacrificing your moral principles. His life is a prime example of how this can be done--one that we can all learn from.” —Kareem Abdul-Jabbar “John Wooden sets an example for all of us by constantly striving to be the best in every aspect of his life. Throughout my life, I have found inspiration and direction in the Bible. Today, I also find inspiration and direction in the words of John Wooden.” —Tom Coughlin, Head Coach, New York Giants “One hundred years—what an amazing life. But here’s what''s even more amazing about John Wooden and the timeless verities his life has embodied.

High performance and stability of actuating materials and structures play a decisive role in their successive applications as sensors and actuators in structural control and robotics. The advances of actuating materials, however, recently encountered a severe reliability issue. For a better understanding toward this issue, scientific efforts are of paramount significance to gain a deep insight into the intricate deformation and failure behaviors of actuating materials. To examine the state of the art in this subject, the general assembly of IUTAM approved in August, 2002 at Cambridge University, UK, a proposal to hold an IUTAM symposium to summarize the relevant research findings. The main themes of the symposium are: (i) the constitutive relations of actuating materials that couple mechanical, electrical, thermal and magnetic properties, as well as incorporate phase transformation and domain switch; (ii) the physical mechanisms of deformation, damage, and fatigue crack growth of actuating materials; (iii) the development of failure-resilient approaches that base on the macro-, meso-, and micro-mechanics analyses; (iv) the investigation of microstructural evolution, stability of phase transformation, and size effects of ferroelectric ceramics, shape memory alloys, actuating polymers, and bio-actuating materials.

Filling this void, Pneumatic Actuating Systems for Automatic Equipment: Structure and Design describes novel constructions along with many of the most commonly applied pneumatic actuating systems. Covering everything from underlying principles to mechanics, numerical modeling, parameter calculation, and control algorithms, this book uses real-world-tested designs to fully illustrate the systems and components presented. After an in-depth discussion of the various types of pneumatic actuators and electropneumatic control valves, the authors explain how to determine the system state variables and then examine open-loop and closed-loop pneumatic actuating systems in detail. They emphasize both the construction and dynamics of actuators to demonstrate and verify their properties before implementation.

Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar’s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a “proper” family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude. John Williams’s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '288', '2010-05-05', '72', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=s7sKxilR83YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Stoner')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Scouring the darkest corners of the Highlands and Western Isles, Robert the Bruce handpicks ten warriors to help him in his quest to free Scotland from English rule. They are the best of the best, chosen for their superior skills in each discipline of warfare. And to lead his secret Highland Guard, Bruce chooses the greatest warrior of all. The ultimate Highland warlord and a swordsman without equal, Tor MacLeod has no intention of being drawn into Scotland’s war against the English. Dedicated to his clan, the fiercely independent chief answers to no one—especially not to his alluring new bride, bartered to him in a bid to secure his command of the deadliest fighting force the world has ever seen. The treacherous chit who made her way to Tor’s bed may have won his hand, but she will never claim his heart. Although her husband’s reputation is as fierce as his manner, Christina Fraser believes that something softer hides beneath his brutal shell. But the only warmth she feels is in their bed, in glorious moments of white-hot desire that disappear with the dawn. When Christina’s reckless bid to win her husband’s love goes awry and thrusts them into danger on the eve of war, Tor will face his ultimate battle: to save his wife and to open his heart—before it’s too late.

Cow Tom, born into slavery in Alabama in 1810 and sold to a Creek Indian chief before his tenth birthday, possessed an extraordinary gift: the ability to master languages. As the new country developed westward, and Indians, settlers, and blacks came into constant contact, Cow Tom became a key translator for his Creek master and was hired out to US military generals. His talent earned him money—but would it also grant him freedom? And what would become of him and his family in the aftermath of the Civil War and the Indian Removal westward? Cow Tom’s legacy lives on—especially in the courageous spirit of his granddaughter Rose. She rises to leadership of the family as they struggle against political and societal hostility intent on keeping blacks and Indians oppressed. But through it all, her grandfather’s indelible mark of courage inspires her—in mind, in spirit, and in a family legacy that never dies. Written in two parts portraying the parallel lives of Cow Tom and Rose, Citizens Creek is a beautifully rendered novel that takes the reader deep into a little known chapter of American history.

As journalist Susan Freinkel points out in this engaging and eye-opening book, we’re nearing a crisis point. We’ve produced as much plastic in the past decade as we did in the entire twentieth century. We’re drowning in the stuff, and we need to start making some hard choices. Freinkel gives us the tools we need with a blend of lively anecdotes and analysis. She combs through scientific studies and economic data, reporting from China and across the United States to assess the real impact of plastic on our lives. She tells her story through eight familiar plastic objects: comb, chair, Frisbee, IV bag, disposable lighter, grocery bag, soda bottle, and credit card.

He had stumbled upon the largest garbage dump on the planet-a spiral nebula where plastic outweighed zooplankton, the ocean''s food base, by a factor of six to one. In Plastic Ocean, Moore recounts his ominous findings and unveils the secret life and hidden properties of plastics. From milk jugs to polymer molecules small enough to penetrate human skin or be unknowingly inhaled, plastic is now suspected of contributing to a host of ailments including infertility, autism, thyroid dysfunction, and some cancers. A call to action as urgent as Rachel Carson''s seminal Silent Spring, Moore''s sobering revelations will be embraced by activists, concerned parents, and seafaring enthusiasts concerned about the deadly impact and implications of this man made blight.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '368', '2011-10-27', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=SLyAg4qJvOQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Plastic Ocean')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The predominant example of such software is the graphical user interface (GUI), which is used as a front-end to most of today''s software applications. The characteristics of GUIs and other modern software present new challenges to software testing. Because recently developed techniques for automated test case generation can generate more tests than are practical to regularly execute, one important challenge is test suite reduction . Test suite reduction seeks to decrease the size of a test suite without overly compromising its original fault detection ability. This research advances the state-of-the-art in test suite reduction by empirically studying a coverage criterion which considers the context in which program concepts are covered. Conventional approaches to test suite reduction were developed and evaluated on batch-style applications and, due to the aforementioned considerations, are not always easily applicable to modern software. Furthermore, many existing techniques fail to consider the context in which code executes inside an event-driven paradigm, where programs wait for and interactively respond to user- and system-generated events. Consequently, they yield reduced test suites with severely impaired fault detection ability. The novel feature of this research is a test suite reduction technique based on the call stack coverage criterion which addresses many of the challenges associated with coverage-based test suite reduction in modern applications. Results show that reducing test suites while maintaining call stack coverage yields good tradeoffs between size reduction and fault detection effectiveness compared to traditional techniques.

The enterprise needs to become more ''connected'' to its own parts, as well as its partners up and down the chains it participates in. So too, we need to embrace new ways of looking at customers to gain deeper, more insightful impressions of what they are telling us about the way they want to buy our products and services. Finally, these signals need converting into corresponding action, driven by the people in the business, leaders and staff alike, who are aligned to their customers'' wishes. This is the world of dynamic supply chain alignment where, increasingly, supply chains are the business. In the follow-up to his hugely successful Strategic Supply Chain Alignment, John Gattorna''s Dynamic Supply Chain Alignment, explores how to create and sustain multiple supply chains with a level of flexibility and responsiveness that allow you to respond to opportunities and threats; at the same time aligning with your suppliers, your partners and your customers.

As firms become progressively more tightly coupled in global supply chains, rather than being large vertically integrated monoliths, risks and opportunities associated with activities upstream or downstream will increasingly impinge upon their own wellbeing. For a firm to thrive, it is increasingly imperative that it be aware of economic, environmental and social dimensions of the entire supply chain it belongs to, and that it proactively monitor and manage those. Finding efficient solutions towards a more sustainable supply chain is increasingly important for managers, but clearly this raise difficult questions, often without clear answers.

Since 2008, however, the European Union has ricocheted between stagnation and crisis. The inability of the eurozone to match the recovery in the USA and UK has exposed its governing structures, institutions and policies as dysfunctional and called into question the viability of a common currency shared by such different economies as Germany and Greece. Designed to bring the European Union closer together, the euro has actually done the opposite- after nearly a decade without growth, unity has been replaced with dissent and enlargements with prospective exits. Joseph Stiglitz argues that Europe''s stagnation and bleak outlook are a direct result of the fundamental flaws inherent in the euro project - economic integration outpacing political integration with a structure that promotes divergence rather than convergence. Money relentlessly leaves the weaker member states and goes to the strong, with debt accumulating in a few ill-favoured countries. The question then is- Can the euro be saved? Laying bare the European Central Bank''s misguided inflation-only mandate and explaining why austerity has condemned Europe to unending stagnation, Stiglitz outlines the fundamental reforms necessary to the structure of the eurozone and the policies imposed on the member countries suffering the most. But the same lack of sufficient political solidarity that led to the creation of a flawed euro twenty years ago suggests that these reforms are unlikely to be adopted. Hoping to avoid the huge costs associated with current policies, Stiglitz proposes two other alternatives- a well-managed end to the common currency; or a bold, new system dubbed ''the flexible euro.''

For decades people have unquestioningly accepted the idea that our goal is to preserve nature in its pristine, pre-human state. But many scientists have come to see this as an outdated dream that thwarts bold new plans to save the environment and prevents us from having a fuller relationship with nature. Humans have changed the landscapes they inhabit since prehistory, and climate change means even the remotest places now bear the fingerprints of humanity. Emma Marris argues convincingly that it is time to look forward and create the "rambunctious garden," a hybrid of wild nature and human management. In this optimistic book, readers meet leading scientists and environmentalists and visit imaginary Edens, designer ecosystems, and Pleistocene parks. Marris describes innovative conservation approaches, including rewilding, assisted migration, and the embrace of so-called novel ecosystems.

The authors introduce a new way to measure bypassing using the patients'' own knowledge of alternative health providers available to them instead of assuming that information as previously done. The authors analyze how perceived health care quality and prices impact patients'' bypassing decisions. The analysis uses data from a Quantitative Service Delivery Survey in Chad''s health sector carried out in 2004. The survey covers 281 primary health care centers and 1,801 patients. The matching of facility data and patient data allows the analysis to control for a wide range of important patient and facility characteristics, such as income, severity of illness, quality of health care, or price of services. The findings show that income inequalities translate into health service inequalities. There is evidence of two distinct types of bypassing activities in Chad: (1) patients from low-income households bypass high-quality facilities they cannot afford to go to low-quality facilities, and (2) rich individuals bypass low-quality facilities and aim for more expensive facilities that also offer a higher quality of care. These significant differences in patients'' facility choices are observed across income groups as well as between rural and urban areas.', DEFAULT, '0', '40', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lVKCcP-xA0sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Bypassing Health Providers: The Quest for Better Price and Quality of Health Care in Chad')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

First, I will examine the roots of both feminist''s and queer theorist''s understandings of sexuality as it relates to gender, pleasure, and danger. After that, I will examine the work of transgender activists who have been in direct conversation with the academy''s theories to illustrate the ways that both feminist and queer approaches have been insufficient in addressing the specificities of the transgender experience. Considering these bodies of literature in conjunction with each other is important, as the ways that transgender activists push conversations around binary gender construction can serve as valuable model for activists concerned with addressing actual, lived realities outside of theory. Further, the challenges transgender bodies pose to both feminist and queer theories demonstrates the pressing need to constantly re-evaluate theories of sex and gender as they relate to embodied experiences. Ultimately, I will propose a new theoretical paradigm, a feminist politics of transgression, which will bring together the work of feminists, queer theorists, and transgender activists in the hopes of providing a platform for more effective collaboration.

These materials consist of metal centers tethered through multifunctional organic linkers to promote higher dimensional compounds. As such, self-assembly under hydrothermal conditions has been employed to synthesize extended dimensional homometallic and heterometallic actinide based coordination polymers. The uranium (VI) and thorium (IV) metal centers in these materials showed an affinity towards binding with the ligand in a bidentate fashion through a carboxylate oxygen atom and nitrogen from a heterocyclic aromatic forming a 5-membered ring. Additionally, the photophysical properties of the uranium based coordination polymers were investigated. The fluorescence of hexavalent uranium in both solution and the solid state is known to derive from vibronic transitions of the central uranyl moiety, UO22+. Upon excitation of the uranyl cation, the characteristic emission between 450-600 nm results from the symmetric stretching of the O=U bond with known vibronic frequency of 860 cm-1. The frequencies for the homometallic materials were calculated to range from 862-894 cm-1 agreeing with the literature value of 860 cm-1. The pyridinedicarboxylic acid series illustrated a fascinating feature in the emission spectra: shoulder peaks. Attempts to correlate the shoulder peaks with the geometric nature of the uranyl cation in each compound are presented herein. When the uranyl cation was excited in the heterometallic compounds within the 3,5-pyrazoledicarboxylic and 4,5-imidazoledicarboxylic acid systems, the characteristic emission was not detected. This observation indicates that the copper (II) metal centers may provide an alternative pathway for non-radiative decay. In compound 13, the copper and uranium metal centers are bridged through a uranyl oxygen atom. This change in the uranyl environment may also contribute to the lack of detectable uranyl emission. Conversely, uranyl emission was observed when either copper (II) or lead (II) was incorporated into the uranium-2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid system (compounds 8 and 11). This occurrence may be the first instance where uranyl emission was observed in the presence of a transition metal in the solid state. These photophysical properties along with the structural schematics of the various systems will be discussed.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '173', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EGKeGhZfzHIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Controlling the Hydrothermal Conditions to Synthesize Novel Uranium-based Heterometallic Coordination Polymers and Their Subsequent Fluorescence Investigations')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Excerpt: NTSC, named for the National Television System Committee, is the analog television system that is used in most of North America, most of South America (except Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and French Guiana), Burma, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, and some Pacific island nations and territories (see map). Most countries using the NTSC standard, as well as those using other analog television standards, are switching to newer digital television standards, of which at least four different ones are in use around the world. North America, parts of Central America, and South Korea are adopting the ATSC standards, while other countries are adopting or have adopted other standards. The first NTSC standard was developed in 1941 and had no provision for color television. In 1953 a second modified version of the NTSC standard was adopted, which allowed color television broadcasting compatible with the existing stock of black-and-white receivers. NTSC was the first widely adopted broadcast color system. After nearly 70 years of use, the vast majority of over-the-air NTSC transmissions in the United States were replaced with digital ATSC on June 12, 2009, and will be by August 31, 2011, in Canada in most markets.

The book begins with the traces of the ditches and barrows made by the earliest inhabitants. It then takes the reader through Roman and Saxon times to the Middle Ages and on to the visible remains of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It vividly records the impact of the industrial revolution and the rapid developments of the nineteenth century, and the final chapters show the motorways, housing estates, city centres and golf courses of the twentieth century. The photographs, which have been chosen from the Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs, cover the full range of sites that can be found in the county. Famous monuments are included - Ely Cathedral, Cambridge colleges and Wimpole Hall - and so are rare but no less intriguing places like burial mounds and forts, abandoned villages and medieval fields.

Like its predecessor, this edition of Indexing Books offers comprehensive, reliable treatment of indexing principles and practices relevant to authors and indexers alike. In addition to practical advice, the book presents a big-picture perspective on the nature and purpose of indexes and their role in published works. New to this edition are discussions of "information overload" and the role of the index, open-system versus closed-system indexing, electronic submission and display of indexes, and trends in software development, among other topics. Mulvany is equally comfortable focusing on the nuts and bolts of indexing—how to determine what is indexable, how to decide the depth of an index, and how to work with publisher instructions—and broadly surveying important sources of indexing guidelines such as The Chicago Manual of Style, Sun Microsystems, Oxford University Press, NISO TR03, and ISO 999. Authors will appreciate Mulvany''s in-depth consideration of the costs and benefits of preparing one''s own index versus hiring a professional, while professional indexers will value Mulvany''s insights into computer-aided indexing. Helpful appendixes include resources for indexers, a worksheet for general index specifications, and a bibliography of sources to consult for further information on a range of topics.

Yet, despite the proliferation of new modalities of regulating infrastructure little is known about what works and why. Why do certain regulatory regimes fail and others succeed? What regulatory designs and institutional features produce optimal outcomes and how? And why do regulatory forms of governance when transplanted into different institutional contexts produce less than uniform outcomes?

And now is the time to begin the transformation. This volume is the culmination of an unprecedented effort to document, analyze, and interpret the full extent of the challenge in developing Sub-Saharan Africa s infrastructure sectors. As a result, it represents the most comprehensive reference currently available on infrastructure in the region. The book covers the five main economic infrastructure sectors information and communication technology, irrigation, power, transport, and water and sanitation. ''Africa s Infrastructure: A Time for Transformation'' reflects the collaboration of a wide array of African regional institutions and development partners under the auspices of the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa. It presents the findings of the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD), a project launched following a commitment in 2005 by the international community (after the G8 summit at Gleneagles, Scotland) to scale up financial support for infrastructure development in Africa. The lack of reliable information in this area made it difficult to evaluate the success of past interventions, prioritize current allocations, and provide benchmarks for measuring future progress, hence the need for the AICD. Africa s infrastructure sectors lag well behind those of the rest of the world, and the gap is widening. Some of the main policy-relevant findings highlighted in the book include the following: infrastructure in the region is exceptionally expensive, with tariffs being many times higher than those found elsewhere. Inadequate and expensive infrastructure is retarding growth by 2 percentage points each year. Solving the problem will cost over US$90 billion per year, which is more than twice what is being spent in Africa today. However, money alone is not the answer. Prudent policies, wise management, and sound maintenance can improve efficiency, thereby stretching the infrastructure dollar. There is the potential to recover an additional US$17 billion a year from within the existing infrastructure resource envelope simply by improving efficiency. For example, improved revenue collection and utility management could generate US$3.3 billion per year. Regional power trade could reduce annual costs by US$2 billion. And deregulating the trucking industry could reduce freight costs by one-half. So, raising more funds without also tackling inefficiencies would be like pouring water into a leaking bucket. Finally, the power sector and fragile states represent particular challenges. Even if every efficiency in every infrastructure sector could be captured, a substantial funding gap of $31 billion a year would remain. Nevertheless, the African people and economies cannot wait any longer.

Thus, an analysis of infrastructures'' contributions to growth must look at the impacts of services as actually perceived, not at indirect indicators that measure only aggregate provision of infrastructure capital. The paper notes that macro and industry level research , although having its limitations, suggest a positive and statistically significant relationship between infrastructure and economic output. However the conclusions derived from this research (most of which derives from developed countries) provide little specific guidance for policy. To gain more practical insights about how infrastructure contributes to economic growth and to improved quality of life, and to understand the welfare costs of inadequate or unreliable infrastructure, it is necessary to look at microeconomic evidence.

This volume of documents covers the occupation of Iraq from the planning stages of the invasion of Iraq in early 2002 to the transfer of governing authority to the Iraqi Interim Government on 28 June 2004. The book presents 595 selected documents including the first complete set of all Regulations, Orders, Memoranda and Public Notices issued by the US-led occupation administration of Iraq, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), several of which were never published on the CPA`s website or promulgated in Alwaqai Aliraqiya, the Official Gazette of Iraq. Some of these legal acts have shaped the economic and political system of present day Iraq and will be part of the country`s legal order for years to come. The book also includes some 120 other CPA and CPA-related documents selected from more than 5000 unclassified CPA documents and received under freedom of information requests lodged in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Switzerland. These documents include instructions and proclamations to the Iraqi people in the early stages of the occupation, organizational charts, internal legal opinions, diplomatic notes, international agreements concluded by the CPA with other States, and numerous internal memoranda for the head of the CPA, Ambassador Paul L Bremer, on legal, diplomatic and political issues. The book also presents for the first time all 235 resolutions passed by the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) between July 2003 and June 2004. The resolutions as well as many of the 25 other important IGC documents (including various political statements, press releases and decrees of the Council`s Higher National De-Ba`athification Commission) have been translated from Arabic and are presented here for the first time in English. These documents are complemented by the relevant United Nations documents on the occupation of Iraq as well as some 50 policy documents of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Iraqi opposition movement as well as all relevant fatwas (religious rulings) of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani which shaped the internal Iraqi political process during the occupation. This collection archives these important documents for future use and makes them easily accessible to researchers and professionals. Considering that the main source of information for the occupying powers in Iraq were the precedents set during the First and Second World Wars, the occupation of Iraq will serve as a modern precedent for future administrations of occupied territory. The documents are made easily accessible by a comprehensive table of documents, a list of abbreviations, more than 1100 explanatory notes and cross-references and a substantive subject index.

To conduct this audit, the report analyzed Iraqi financial data, reviewed U.S. and Iraqi documents, and interviewed U.S. and Iraqi officials.

While private copying was practiced in the analogue world too, it was tolerated due to its minimal impact and to the difficulties related to its monitoring. Yet, its permissibility is ambiguous in the digital environment; this is because digitalisation has enabled ordinary individuals to make and share copies of copyrighted works easily, for no cost and with no degradation in terms of quality. Scholars and lawmakers stress the decisive role of private copying in striking an adequate balance between the freedom to use copyrighted works and the protection of the rightholders'' interests in the digital world. In Europe, private copying is explicitly permitted under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society and the national laws that implement it. Despite being a lawful activity in the great majority of European Member States, digital private copying remains a highly controversial phenomenon and the scope of digital private copying remains legally unclear.This book offers an original analysis of private copying and determines the actual scope of private copying as an area of end-user freedom in the digital world. In particular, it examines the permissibility of digital private copying with a view to clarify the legal uncertainty as to its scope. The basis of this examination is Article 5(2)(b) of the Information Society Directive. Under this Article, the use of copyrighted works ought to be ''private'' and ''non-commercial'' to be permitted; these concepts, however, do not translate well, and tend to be less sharp, in the digital environment.

When facing previous speculative attacks (starting October 1997), the authorities had followed traditional policies of raising interest rates. But, by August 1998, such policies had helped to batter asset markets; property prices and output were falling, and confidence was low. Moreover, the speculators had developed an ingenious ''double-play'', simultaneously selling both the foreign exchange market and the Hang Seng equity market short; whether the authorities used an interest rate defence, or abandoned the ''link'', the speculators would gain either way. So, the authorities decided on a bold, unexpected and unconventional response to reports of a further attack. They would undertake counter-intervention, again both in the equity and foreign exchange markets. This was the largest, and most successful, counter-speculative intervention ever undertaken. In comparison to the size of Hong Kong''s economy, it was massive. On one day - Friday, 28 August, 1998 - the authorities bought up around five per cent of the total capitalization of the Hang Seng. Despite the eventual success of the exercise, the authorities have been quite reticent about their actions, revealing only the aggregate amounts of purchases of each stock intervened. This book uses publicly available market data to trace out the authorities'' actions on a blow-by-blow basis, primarily in the Hang Seng equity market, but also in the futures and foreign exchange market.

The War of the Soups and the Sparks tells the saga of the dispute between the pharmacologists, who had uncovered the first evidence that nerves communicate by releasing chemicals, and the neurophysiologists, experts on the nervous system, who dismissed the evidence and remained committed to electrical explanations. The protagonists of this story are Otto Loewi and Henry Dale, who received Nobel Prizes for their work, and Walter Cannon, who would have shared the prize with them if he had not been persuaded to adopt a controversial theory (how that happened is an important part of this history). Valenstein sets his story of scientific discovery against the backdrop of two world wars and examines the fascinating lives of several scientists whose work was affected by the social and political events of their time. He recounts such stories as Loewi''s arrest by Nazi storm troopers and Dale''s efforts at helping key scientists escape Germany. The War of the Soups and the Sparks reveals how science and scientists work. Valenstein describes the observations and experiments that led to the discovery of neurotransmitters and sheds light on what determines whether a novel concept will gain acceptance among the scientific community.

McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild. Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild. Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless''s short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless. Digging deeply, he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons. When McCandless''s innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless''s uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity , and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, Into the Wild is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer''s stoytelling blaze through every page.

These techniques will allow students to invent, formalize, and justify rules with which to reason about a variety of programming languages. Although the treatment is elementary, several of the topics covered are drawn from recent research, including the vital area of concurency. The book contains many exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.Starting with basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic semantics are illustrated on a simple language of while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of Godel''s incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics, is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an introduction to the theory of computability based on while-programs.Following a presentation of domain theory, the semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation. This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the proofs of the correspondence between the operation and denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on the use of information systems to represent domains.

The advantages of a common currency include lower transaction costs, increased stability, and greater insulation of central banks from pressures to provide monetary financing. Disadvantages relate to asymmetries among countries, especially in their terms of trade and in the degree of fiscal discipline. More disciplined countries will not want to form a union with countries whose excessive spending puts upward pressure on the central bank''s monetary expansion. In T he Monetary Geography of Africa, Paul Masson and Catherine Pattillo review the history of monetary arrangements on the continent and analyze the current situation and prospects for further integration. They apply lessons from both experience and theory that lead to a number of conclusions. To begin with, West Africa faces a major problem because Nigeria has both asymmetric terms of trade—it is a large oil exporter while its potential partners are oil importers—and most important, large fiscal imbalances. Secondly, a monetary union among all eastern or southern African countries seems infeasible at this stage, since a number of countries suffer from the effects of civil conflicts and drought and are far from achieving the macroeconomic stability of South Africa. Lastly, the plan by Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda to create a common currency seems to be generally compatible with other initiatives that could contribute to greater regional solidarity. However, economic gains would likely favor Kenya, which, unlike the other two countries, has substantial exports to its neighbors, and this may constrain the political will needed to proceed. A more promising strategy for monetary integration would be to build on existing monetary unions—the CFA franc zone in western and central Africa and the Common Monetary Area in southern Africa.

This research is a first step towards building an intelligent autonomous surgical system. The developed hardware/software interface allows integrating other technologies, such as eye tracking, with Aesop. An eye-gaze tracker system has been integrated with the developed motion control system. This system allows the camera mounted on the Aesop to be controlled by the direction of gaze of the surgeon.

Much of this attention emanates from a recognition of the challenges inherent in this move towards greater private participation in infrastructure delivery. Scholars agree that PPPs require new types of public sector capacity from governments in order to address these challenges. Unfortunately the locus and structure of this new capacity remain poorly understood. In this dissertation I propose that the need for this "PPP enabling capacity" has not been addressed by a reformation of public agents alone. Rather, a network of new "enabling organizations" (public, private and non-profit) has emerged in response to the emergent need for new capacity. Adopting the concept of "organization field" from institutional theory, I define this network of organizations as the "PPP-enabling field." I employ a qualitative case-based methodology to investigate the novel concept of the "PPP-enabling field" by looking at three leading cases of PPP-enabling fields: the Canadian province of British Columbia, the Australian state of Victoria, and South Africa. My analysis consists of three main parts. First, I examine these three fields in some detail. I identify differences in various field attributes, including the salient organizational actors, specific roles and responsibilities, dominant institutional logics (cognitive frames and ways of thinking) in the field, and the governance arrangements that guide action in the fields. Next, I turn to historical accounts of field formation in each of the three cases in an attempt to explain the reasons for the observed differences. Finally, I consider the impacts of these field differences on the overall "success" of PPP enablement in a region. To do this, I identify various measures of PPP program "success" and theorize about the linkages between PPP-enabling field characteristics and PPP program outcomes. This dissertation contributes to a more complete understanding of PPP-enablement by delineating, in some detail, contemporary forms of PPP-enabling fields. In this way I move beyond the normative approach that characterizes so much of the current literature on PPPs, to show how and why PPP-enabling fields emerge quite differently in different countries, and to propose functional and outcome implications of the field differences.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '2010', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bqYisSVQ5i0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Exploring the Networks of Organizations that Enable and Govern Infrastructure Public-private Partnerships')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The fireman is coming. Stay cool. No one knows exactly when it began or where it originated. A terrifying new plague is spreading like wildfire across the country, striking cities one by one: Boston, Detroit, Seattle. The doctors call it Draco Incendia Trychophyton. To everyone else it’s Dragonscale, a highly contagious, deadly spore that marks its hosts with beautiful black and gold marks across their bodies—before causing them to burst into flames. Millions are infected; blazes erupt everywhere. There is no antidote. No one is safe. Harper Grayson, a compassionate, dedicated nurse as pragmatic as Mary Poppins, treated hundreds of infected patients before her hospital burned to the ground. Now she’s discovered the telltale gold-flecked marks on her skin. When the outbreak first began, she and her husband, Jakob, had made a pact: they would take matters into their own hands if they became infected. To Jakob’s dismay, Harper wants to live—at least until the fetus she is carrying comes to term. At the hospital, she witnessed infected mothers give birth to healthy babies and believes hers will be fine too. . . if she can live long enough to deliver the child. Convinced that his do-gooding wife has made him sick, Jakob becomes unhinged, and eventually abandons her as their placid New England community collapses in terror. The chaos gives rise to ruthless Cremation Squads—armed, self-appointed posses roaming the streets and woods to exterminate those who they believe carry the spore. But Harper isn’t as alone as she fears: a mysterious and compelling stranger she briefly met at the hospital, a man in a dirty yellow fire fighter’s jacket, carrying a hooked iron bar, straddles the abyss between insanity and death. Known as The Fireman, he strolls the ruins of New Hampshire, a madman afflicted with Dragonscale who has learned to control the fire within himself, using it as a shield to protect the hunted . . . and as a weapon to avenge the wronged. In the desperate season to come, as the world burns out of control, Harper must learn the Fireman’s secrets before her life—and that of her unborn child—goes up in smoke.', DEFAULT, '12.99', '768', '2016-05-17', '962', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=f4lKCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Fireman')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

(Boston Globe) Boston in 1775 is an island city occupied by British troops after a series of incendiary incidents by patriots who range from sober citizens to thuggish vigilantes. After the Boston Tea Party, British and American soldiers and Massachusetts residents have warily maneuvered around each other until April 19, when violence finally erupts at Lexington and Concord. In June, however, with the city cut off from supplies by a British blockade and Patriot militia poised in siege, skirmishes give way to outright war in the Battle of Bunker Hill. It would be the bloodiest battle of the Revolution to come, and the point of no return for the rebellious colonists. Philbrick brings a fresh perspective to every aspect of the story. He finds new characters, and new facets to familiar ones. The real work of choreographing rebellion falls to a thirty-three year old physician named Joseph Warren who emerges as the on-the-ground leader of the Patriot cause and is fated to die at Bunker Hill. Others in the cast include Paul Revere, Warren’s fiancé the poet Mercy Scollay, a newly recruited George Washington, the reluctant British combatant General Thomas Gage and his more bellicose successor William Howe, who leads the three charges at Bunker Hill and presides over the claustrophobic cauldron of a city under siege as both sides play a nervy game of brinkmanship for control. With passion and insight, Philbrick reconstructs the revolutionary landscape—geographic and ideological—in a mesmerizing narrative of the robust, messy, blisteringly real origins of America.

Nathan Hill is a maestro.” —John Irving From the suburban Midwest to New York City to the 1968 riots that rocked Chicago and beyond, The Nix explores—with sharp humor and a fierce tenderness—the resilience of love and home, even in times of radical change. It’s 2011, and Samuel Andresen-Anderson—college professor, stalled writer—has a Nix of his own: his mother, Faye. He hasn’t seen her in decades, not since she abandoned the family when he was a boy. Now she’s re-appeared, having committed an absurd crime that electrifies the nightly news, beguiles the internet, and inflames a politically divided country. The media paints Faye as a radical hippie with a sordid past, but as far as Samuel knows, his mother was an ordinary girl who married her high-school sweetheart. Which version of his mother is true? Two facts are certain: she’s facing some serious charges, and she needs Samuel’s help. To save her, Samuel will have to embark on his own journey, uncovering long-buried secrets about the woman he thought he knew, secrets that stretch across generations and have their origin all the way back in Norway, home of the mysterious Nix. As he does so, Samuel will confront not only Faye’s losses but also his own lost love, and will relearn everything he thought he knew about his mother, and himself.', DEFAULT, '12.99', '640', '2016-08-30', '24', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=G-9RCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Nix')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Those who choose celibacy are often left to deal with loneliness and the hunger for relationships. How can gay Christians experience God''s favor and blessing in the midst of a struggle that for many brings a crippling sense of shame and guilt? Weaving together reflections from his own life and the lives of other Christians, such as Henri Nouwen and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Hill offers a fresh perspective on these questions.

Drinking water turned to poison. Mass incarcerations. We’ve heard the individual stories. Now a leading public intellectual and acclaimed journalist offers a powerful, paradigm-shifting analysis of America’s current state of emergency, finding in these events a larger and more troubling truth about race, class, and what it means to be “Nobody.” Protests in Ferguson, Missouri and across the United States following the death of Michael Brown revealed something far deeper than a passionate display of age-old racial frustrations. They unveiled a public chasm that has been growing for years, as America has consistently and intentionally denied significant segments of its population access to full freedom and prosperity. In Nobody, scholar and journalist Marc Lamont Hill presents a powerful and thought-provoking analysis of race and class by examining a growing crisis in America: the existence of a group of citizens who are made vulnerable, exploitable and disposable through the machinery of unregulated capitalism, public policy, and social practice. These are the people considered “Nobody” in contemporary America. Through on-the-ground reporting and careful research, Hill shows how this Nobody class has emerged over time and how forces in America have worked to preserve and exploit it in ways that are both humiliating and harmful. To make his case, Hill carefully reconsiders the details of tragic events like the deaths of Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, and Freddie Gray, and the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. He delves deeply into a host of alarming trends including mass incarceration, overly aggressive policing, broken court systems, shrinking job markets, and the privatization of public resources, showing time and time again the ways the current system is designed to worsen the plight of the vulnerable. Timely and eloquent, Nobody is a keen observation of the challenges and contradictions of American democracy, a must-read for anyone wanting to better understand the race and class issues that continue to leave their mark on our country today.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '272', '2016-07-26', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jOjPCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Nobody')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The book attempts to balance the literary, historical, and theological issues pertaining to each individual book and to the Old Testament as a whole. The main portion of the survey treats each book of the Old Testament in the order of the English canon. This information does not simply rehash the biblical material, but assumes that the Scriptures are being read alongside the survey. The book focuses its primary attention on the purpose and message of each book and attempts to show how the literary structure of each one has been used to accomplish the author''s purpose. The survey also introduces readers to the issues of hermeneutics (general and special), history (Israelite and Near Eastern), archaeology, canon, geography, Old Testament theology (biblical and systematic), and critical methodologies. All these issues are dealt with in separate chapters at a basic introductory level that never allows the reader to lose sight, as it were, of the forest while wandering through the trees. In addressing critical issues of date and authorship, the survey avoids a polemical stance. Hill and Watson seek to depend on the evidence of the text rather than on presuppositions to substantiate their views. Their commitment to the authority of the biblical text results in a book that, while notably evangelical, is not always traditional. The authors approach the survey mindful of two complicating factors in Old Testament study. First, God''s revelation did not come by way of the English language or through Western culture, and therefore we today have to work carefully to receive the message clearly. Second, even when we are listening, we have a tendency to be selective about what we hear or to try to make the message conform to our ideas. The solution is to allow the Bible to speak for itself. The informed reader will find much innovation here and a keen awareness of current scholarship relating to the Old Testament. Above all, this textbook will bring a new vigor and excitement to the Old Testament as readers learn to discover its story for themselves and see how to understand it as a substantial part of God''s self-revelation to humankind. This survey is well illustrated with maps, charts, and photographs. Additional features are the questions for study and the annotated reading list at the end of each chapter.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '800', '2010-05-11', '18', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WC80zxPIgyQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A Survey of the Old Testament')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

In it he shares his most treasured memories and never-before-seen photographs as he looks back on an extraordinary life on and off the court. Hailed by many as the greatest coach in the history of American sports, John Wooden is as famous for his personal philosophy as he is for his career achievements. He inspired, guided, and motivated generations of fans with his bestselling books on leadership, values, family, and the true meaning of success. Coach Wooden wrote his final book, The Wisdom of Wooden: My Century On and Off the Court, in the last months before his death. Filled with his most treasured memories and more than 100 photographs, many never-before seen, it captures a life spent teaching, guiding, and serving others. Starting with his father’s now-famous 7 Point Creed—including “Make Each Day Your Masterpiece,” “Help Others,” and “Be True to Yourself,”—Coach Wooden affirms the principles to true success that helped him become an All American at Purdue University, a winning coach at Indiana State University, and an iconic sports figure at UCLA. Yet anyone who knows John Wooden knows his record on the court was only part of the story. In The Wisdom of Wooden the legendary coach offers readers a rare glimpse not just behind the scenes but inside the man; not just on the court but in the huddles; not just his maxims but his poems, those he wrote and those he loved; not just the people he inspired, but the family, friends, and fans who inspired him; not just the lessons he taught but the lessons he learned; not just what was on his mind but what was in his heart. Ultimately it was the life he lived that served as a model for his greatest lesson of all: a deep commitment to family, friends, and faith—the bedrock values of the man we all called, “Coach.” Praise for John Wooden “The Wisdom of Wooden has given me the life that I have . . . Thanks, Coach, for your faith and patience.” —Bill Walton “The Wisdom of Wooden is a lifetime of Coach Wooden’s ideas on how to live life without sacrificing your moral principles. His life is a prime example of how this can be done--one that we can all learn from.” —Kareem Abdul-Jabbar “John Wooden sets an example for all of us by constantly striving to be the best in every aspect of his life. Throughout my life, I have found inspiration and direction in the Bible. Today, I also find inspiration and direction in the words of John Wooden.” —Tom Coughlin, Head Coach, New York Giants “One hundred years—what an amazing life. But here’s what''s even more amazing about John Wooden and the timeless verities his life has embodied.

Long gone are our days of being kings of the manufacturing industry, we are now immersed in the world of ‘service’ where the relationship between an organization and the customer is an integral part of the ‘product’ offering. The nation is suffering from a widespread lack of truly customer-satisfying service. We lack the very thing that we need to make this new paradigm work efficiently: service-ability. Organizations of all kinds are facing high customer churn, serious customer antagonism, loss of consumer confidence and plummeting customer satisfaction. Research shows that totally satisfying the customer is the only thing that will secure loyalty and offer significant competitive advantage. Yet still, on a daily basis we encounter service that frustrates us. Whilst the emergence of technology has no doubt brought efficiency to many areas of business activity, including the third sector, it has led to the standardised and indifferent service we regularly receive. We appear to have lost sight that people do business with people. Through efficient technology, our organisations may be serviceable but they are not service able. The arrival of Generation Y and the developments in social media, provide businesses with a whole new way to engage with their customers, but also provide a new way for customers to rate companies, products and services: not always in a positive manner. ‘Like’ or ‘#Fail’ have become part of our social language. Organizations that refocus on the need to treat customers in a way that satisfies them, and not the technology, will have better customer retention, lower costs of replacement and will build their brand value through better reputations.

Part 1, the report of the Committee, presents a wide-ranging discussion of testing issues. The text has been kept largely free of the critical apparatus of scholarly literature. Chapters 1 through 3 provide an overview of the controversies surrounding testing, an introduction to the concepts, methods, and terminology of ability testing, a brief history of testing in the United States, and a discussion of the proliferation of legal requirements that have come to surround the use of tests. Chapters 4 through 6 describe test use for employment selection and educational purposes, point out common types of misuse, and make recommendations about how tests might be better used to preserve the integrity of the technology while at the same time responding to legitimate social, institutional, and individual goals. Chapter 7 takes a look at the limitations of standardized tests and then attempts to establish a sense of proportion by placing the controversy over testing within the context of the larger social currents that influence the course of national life.

The typical objective of placement is to minimize half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL). To address the timing and layout closure problems brought forth by the aggressive scaling of semiconductor technologies, there is a growing trend in dealing with routing resource constraints and performing physical synthesis techniques in the placement step. In this thesis, we develop techniques at various stages of placement to minimize wirelength and improve routability. In the global placement stage, we consider analytical placement approaches to minimize HPWL. We smooth the HPWL function by recursive extension of two-variable max functions. In the detailed placement stage, we propose a congestion-driven white space allocation approach and an effective local minimization technique to achieve better routability and routed wirelength. We also extend our white space allocation approach as an incremental placement technique to accommodate incremental changes in a placement due to physical synthesis techniques, including gate sizing and buffer insertion.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '116', '2006', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AViD-JCWC2AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Placement of VLSI Circuits')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This second volume compliments the first by presenting as complete an analysis as possible of current oilfield theory and technology, for accomplishment of maximum production of oil. Many different processes have been developed and field tested for enhancement of oil recovery. The emerging philosophy is that no single process is applicable to all petroleum reservoirs. Each must be treated as unique, and carefully evaluated for characteristics that are amenable to one or two of the proven technologies of EOR. This book will aid the engineer in field evaluation and selection of the best EOR technology for a given oilfield. Even the emerging technology of microbial applications to enhance oil recovery are reviewed and explained in terms that are easily understood by field engineers.

Here is the story of how, beginning well before the advent of machine production in 1780, these men created a potent innovation (Beckert calls it war capitalism, capitalism based on unrestrained actions of private individuals; the domination of masters over slaves, of colonial capitalists over indigenous inhabitants), and crucially affected the disparate realms of cotton that had existed for millennia. We see how this thing called war capitalism shaped the rise of cotton, and then was used as a lever to transform the world. The empire of cotton was, from the beginning, a fulcrum of constant global struggle between slaves and planters, merchants and statesmen, farmers and merchants, workers and factory owners. In this as in so many other ways, Beckert makes clear how these forces ushered in the modern world.

(Booklist) In 1942 Paris, gifted architect Lucien Bernard accepts a commission that will bring him a great deal of money and maybe get him killed. But if he''s clever enough, he''ll avoid any trouble. All he has to do is design a secret hiding place for a wealthy Jewish man, a space so invisible that even the most determined German officer won''t find it. He sorely needs the money, and outwitting the Nazis who have occupied his beloved city is a challenge he can''t resist. But when one of his hiding spaces fails horribly, and the problem of where to hide a Jew becomes terribly personal, Lucien can no longer ignore what''s at stake. The Paris Architect asks us to consider what we owe each other, and just how far we''ll go to make things right.

Burning of fossil fuels has greatly increased the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, trapping more of the sun''s energy near the Earth''s surface. In response, our planet is warming at an unprecedented rate, and ecosystems are already changing. Modern industrialized economies depend largely on the combustion of coal, oil and gas. However, if current greenhouse gas emission rates continue, altered temperature and precipitation patterns will seriously impact ecosystems and human welfare. Many nations have adopted policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but a comprehensive and effective international climate treaty remains part of a continuing debate. "Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions," is divided into three main sections: Climate Change: Past, Present, and Future; Ecological Effects of Climate Change; Human Dimensions of Climate Change. It presents an accurate account of what we do and do not know about climate change.

Now, she brings together a number of the leading researchers in the area of platform strategy to give us a book that will be a key reference for both practitioners and academics. Adam Brandenburger, New York University, US Annabelle Gawer s collected volume of research shows that a vibrant community of scholars has arisen around platforms and innovation. Each of the chapters is first rate, with top researchers offering some of their latest work. This will be an indispensable book for students of innovation and technology management everywhere. Henry Chesbrough, University of California, Berkeley, US Annabelle Gawer s Platforms, Markets and Innovation is the first serious exploration of the critical but subtle role that platforms play in business, society and our personal lives. As digital technologies penetrate every nook and cranny of the world around us, we rely on platforms to both help us use the new technologies, as well as to organize new markets of innovation that add applications on top of the platforms and make them far more valuable. Dr Gawer s excellent book is designed to help us understand the mysterious nature of platforms. It brings together the insights of twenty-four experts around the world who contributed to the fourteen chapters of the book. Dr Gawer s book is invaluable to anyone trying to understand the nuanced nature of platforms, and their implications for the evolution of innovation in the 21st century. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, IBM Academy of Technology, US The emergence of platforms is a novel phenomenon impacting most industries, from products to services. Industry platforms such as Microsoft Windows or Google, embedded within industrial ecosystems, have redesigned our industrial landscapes, upset the balance of power between firms, fostered innovation and raised new questions on competition and innovation. Annabelle Gawer presents cutting-edge contributions from 24 top international scholars from 19 universities across Europe, the USA and Asia, from the disciplines of strategy, economics, innovation, organization studies and knowledge management. The novel insights assembled in this volume constitute a fundamental step towards an empirically based, nuanced understanding of the nature of platforms and the implications they hold for the evolution of industrial innovation. The book provides an overview of platforms and discusses governance, management, design and knowledge issues. With a multidisciplinary approach, this book will strongly appeal to academics and advanced students in management, innovation, strategy, economics and design.

Yet many firms inexplicably develop one product at a time, and by doing so fail to embrace commonality, compatibility, standardization, or modularization among different products and product lines. At last, in this timely book, Marc H. Meyer and Alvin P. Lehnerd provide a formula for turning products into profits, enabling companies to design technologically superior products more easily. Their solution is, in two words, PRODUCT PLATFORMS. They argue that firms must focus their energies on developing families of products simultaneously which share common components and technology. The authors describe how the champions of product development separate themselves from less sophisticated companies by building entire families of strong products from a single "platform" of common product structures, technologies, and automated product processes. These successful companies recognize and respond to new market opportunities by integrating core skills and technology in the form of new products. In this easy-to-read and practical book, the authors masterfully elucidate this dynamic and forward-thinking strategy which enables companies to develop innovative products faster, more cheaply, and with less effort. Drawing on in-depth case studies and personal experience with successful companies such as Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Black & Decker, and Boeing, Meyer and Lehnerd show managers how to create extraordinary products and thereby set the standard for combined value and cost leadership in their products. They argue that when a company''s products are robust—highly functional, elegant in their design, reasonably priced, and a pleasure to use—the corporation will be equally robust. More importantly, The Power of Product Platforms reveals the methodology and organizational approach for designing, developing, and revitalizing strong products that enable the firm to make the transition from one generation of technology to the next. The authors also explain how well-designed product platforms can generate streams of derivative products through a continuous systematic process of renewal. Meyer and Lehnerd apply this methodology to a broad range of industries; manufacturing in both consumer and industrial markets, software firms, and Internet information services providers. This clear prescription for transforming the bottom line by aggressively managing product development and innovation will become required reading for large and small corporations alike, including entrepreneurs, all of whom depend on the excellence of their new products for growth.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '288', '2011-11-01', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HXyjYVe2LcYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Power of Product Platforms')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Think about a traditional platform like a mall, which connects many different customers to many different stores. They charge their largest stores--the anchors--the lowest fees, while they charge smaller retailers and kiosks higher fees (and they don’t charge customers at all, even though they could conceivably charge for something like parking). That pricing structure makes sense, even though it may seem discriminatory, because the anchor stores are key to getting customers to show up. But there are still more twists and turns to how platforms operate. Plus, while the platform business model may seem appealing, it can be difficult to know if you should transform your business and--even if you should--how to do it. Yet companies that transform their pricing practices, incentive plans, and organizational structures are today’s power brokers. InMatchmakers, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, two economists who were among the first to analyze platform businesses and discover their principles, explain the logic of platforms and how to analyze your own opportunities. Rich with stories from the platform winners as well as from those who mismanaged the transition,Matchmakers will be the one book readers need in order to navigate the appealing but confusing world of multi-sided markets.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '256', '2016-05-24', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nZqfjgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'Matchmakers')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Digital cultures thrive on creativity, developing new forces of organization to overcome repetition and reach brilliance. In order to understand the processes that produce culture, the author introduces the concept of the art platform, a specific configuration of creative passions, codes, events, individuals and works that are propelled by cultural currents and maintained through digitally native means. Art platforms can occur in numerous contexts bringing about genuinely new cultural production, that, given enough force, come together to sustain an open mechanism while negotiating social, technical and political modes of power. Software art, digital forms of literature, 8-bit music, 3D art forms, pro-surfers, and networks of geeks are test beds for enquiry into what brings and holds art platforms together. Goriunova provides a new means of understanding the development of cultural forms on the Internet, placing the phenomenon of participatory and social networks in a conceptual and historical perspective, and offering powerful tools for researching cultural phenomena overlooked by other approaches.', DEFAULT, '40.76', '176', '2012-05-23', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wmIlTZUofAwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Art Platforms and Cultural Production on the Internet')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Excerpt: The rial (in Persian: ISO 4217 code IRR) is the currency of Iran. It is subdivided into 100 dinar but, because of the very low current value of the rial, no fraction of the rial is used in accounting. Although the "toman" is no longer an official unit of Iranian currency, Iranians commonly express amounts of money and prices of goods in "tomans." For this purpose, one "toman" equals 10 rials. Despite this usage, amounts of money and prices of goods are virtually always written in rials. For example, the sign next to a loaf of bread in a store would state the price in rials, e.g., "200 Rials," even though the clerk, if asked, would say that the bread costs "20 tomans." There is no official symbol for the currency but the Iranian standard ISIRI 820 defined a symbol for use on typewriters (mentioning that it is an invention of the standards committee itself) and the two Iranian standards ISIRI 2900 and ISIRI 3342 define a character code to be used for it. The Unicode Standard has a compatibility character defined (HTML: ﷼ ). The rial was first introduced in 1798 as a coin worth 1250 dinar or one eighth of a toman. In 1825, the rial ceased to be issued, with the qiran of 1000 dinars (one tenth of a toman) being issued as part of a decimal system. The rial replaced the qiran at par in 1932, although it was divided into one hundred (new) dinars.

It emphasizes the basic principles, and aims to progress rapidly to the point of being able to handle physically and mathematically interesting problems, without getting bogged down in excessive formalism. Lagrangian methods are introduced at a relatively early stage, to get students to appreciate their use in simple contexts. Later chapters use Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods extensively, but in a way that aims to be accessible to undergraduates, while including modern developments at the appropriate level of detail. The subject has been developed considerably recently while retaining a truly central role for all students of physics and applied mathematics.This edition retains all the main features of the fourth edition, including the two chapters on geometry of dynamical systems and on order and chaos, and the new appendices on conics and on dynamical systems near a critical point. The material has been somewhat expanded, in particular to contrast continuous and discrete behaviours. A further appendix has been added on routes to chaos (period-doubling) and related discrete maps.

The great secret of our time is that there are still uncharted frontiers to explore and new inventions to create. In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself. Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.

The authors analyze the costs and benefits of one-to-one computing programs through consideration of multiple indicators and examine the evaluation reports of various projects within their analytical framework to present a comprehensive summary of outcomes of one-to-one computing projects. What happens when each child has a networked computer? The authors analyze existing data with the goal of gaining insights and making suggestions and recommendations for policy makers, teachers, and parents. What should schools purchase or lease - is there an ideal device? These authors examine the relative advantages and disadvantages of different devices and implementation schemes. How do we know if one-to-one computing is making a difference? The authors review the evaluation plans of the various projects and propose a framework for comprehensive evaluation and research on one-to-one computing.

As a member of the Toronto Police Service Hold-Up Squad, Jack is tired of always having to clean up after the fact. When the blueprints of a robbery that has yet to take place land on his desk, there''s only one problem...he can''t read a word of them. The details of the heist are contained on a computer hard drive, protected by an unbreakable security code, seized in an explosive police raid on a suspected gunrunner. Katherine Sharpe, beautiful, brilliant and ambitious, is the head of a cutting-edge computer research firm on the verge of introducing an earth-shattering technological breakthrough, something she’s been working on her whole adult life. But Theodore Sumner, the Chairman of the Board and her nemesis at ComTech, has other ideas. When he threatens to bring her dreams crashing down around her, Katherine sets in motion a plan to stop him that quickly spirals out of control.

The high point of that backlash is the Republican Party''s success in building the most unnatural of alliances: between blue-collar Midwesterners and Wall Street business interests, workers and bosses, populists and right-wingers. In asking "what ''s the matter with Kansas?"—how a place famous for its radicalism became one of the most conservative states in the union—Frank, a native Kansan and onetime Republican, seeks to answer some broader American riddles: Why do so many of us vote against our economic interests? Where''s the outrage at corporate manipulators? And whatever happened to middle-American progressivism? The questions are urgent as well as provocative. Frank answers them by examining pop conservatism—the bestsellers, the radio talk shows, the vicious political combat—and showing how our long culture wars have left us with an electorate far more concerned with their leaders'' "values" and down-home qualities than with their stands on hard questions of policy. A brilliant analysis—and funny to boot—What''s the Matter with Kansas? presents a critical assessment of who we are, while telling a remarkable story of how a group of frat boys, lawyers, and CEOs came to convince a nation that they spoke on behalf of the People. *Los Angeles Times', DEFAULT, '9.99', '320', '2007-04-01', '20', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AJKrMcOyQ3wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'What''s the Matter with Kansas?')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The authors show how this wide-open, gin-soaked town gave birth to a music that was more basic and more viscerally exciting than other styles of jazz, its singers belting out a rough-and-tumble urban style of blues, its piano players pounding out a style later known as "boogie-woogie." We visit the great landmarks, like the Reno Club, the "Biggest Little Club in the World," where Lester Young and Count Basie made jazz history, and Charlie Parker began his musical education in the alley out back. The lives of the great musicians who made Kansas City swing are illuminated, with colorful profiles of jazz figures such as Mary Lou Williams, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Rushing, and Andy Kirk and his "Clouds of Joy."

Ward develop the terminology and set forth the economic theory of commodity advertising, as well as the legal and industrial structures necessary to underwriting commodity programs. Forker and Ward offer methods for evaluating the economic effectiveness of commodity programs, suggest techniques for integrating advertising and promotion expenditures into demand analysis, and propose a new method for estimating the functional relationship between advertising expenditures and expected sales response - one that provides a more realistic estimate of the shape of the advertising response function. They also present case studies on the advertising programs for fluid milk, beef, apples, citrus, wool, fresh tomato, catfish, potatoes, soybean, cheese, and fats and oils. Commodity Advertising demonstrates that like their brand counterparts, generic advertising programs do have a positive impact on consumer demand. While the impact varies among commodity groups, research indicates that well planned and executed generic advertising can yield benefits to the producers who fund the programs as well as the processors and consumers of the commodity. The authors treat advertising as information, and they present methods to estimate the value of this information to consumers and to the commodity industry. In general, advertising yields greater benefits to the producers of the commodity when the industry''s supply response is inelastic. But many other factors, including product quality, funding base, pricing, available substitutes, and consumer preferences influence the ability of commodity advertising programs to be effective. The authors discuss the influence on commodity demand of all these factors. The book will interest both agricultural and many nonagricultural groups, including academic, nonprofit, and governmental associations, businesses, and others who wish to explore the opportunities created by generic advertising and promotion efforts.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '294', '1993-01-01', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d8LZ1cQ4wroC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Commodity Advertising')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Through the prism of behavioral economics, neuroscience, and psychology, they reveal the hidden influences and surprising cues that inspire and derail us—on the field and in the stands—and by extension, in corporate board rooms, office settings, and our daily lives. In this irresistible narrative romp, Wertheim and Sommers usher us from professional football to the NBA to Grand Slam tennis, from the psychology of athletes self-handicapping their performance in the boxing ring or the World Series, to an explanation of why even the glimpse of a finish line can lift us beyond ordinary physical limits. They explore why Tom Brady and other starting NFL quarterbacks all seem to look like fashion models; why fans of teams like the Cubs, Mets, and any franchise from Cleveland love rooting for a loser; why the best players make the worst coaches; why hockey goons (and fans) would rather fight at home than on the road; and why the arena t-shirt cannon has something to teach us about human nature.

If you are a developer or an administrator, you''ll love the chapter that explores PostgreSQL performance. The authors explain how PostgreSQL stores data on disk (and in memory) and how to measure and influence the effectiveness of PostgreSQL''s caching mechanisms. You''ll also learn how PostgreSQL generates and evaluates execution plans. The authors explain all of the query operators that can appear in the results of an EXPLAIN command, describing the performance implications of each operator as well as the conditions which will cause PostgreSQL to use that operator. PostgreSQL is also a complete guide for the developer. Whether you''re developing with C, C++, ODBC, Embedded SQL, Java, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python or PHP, you''ll find a comprehensive description of the PostgreSQL API for your language of choice. Easy to follow exercises will walk you through the development of working applications that fully demonstrate the features offered by each API. You will also find a chapter that describes the PL/pgSQL server-side procedural language, learning how to build triggers, functions, and stored-procedures. The authors have even included a chapter that walks you through the process of extending the PostgreSQL server with custom-written C functions and new data types. The accompanying web site, www.conjectrix.com, contains downloadable versions of all of the sample code and a wealth of PostgreSQL-related resources. The last section of PostgreSQL was written for the PostgreSQL administrator. You will learn how to install PostgreSQL on Windows, Linux, and Unix systems, from source code or from pre-compiled installers. The authors have described all of the PostgreSQL configuration options (compile-time, startup, and on-the-fly). The chapter on PostgreSQL security describes all of the authentication protocols that you can choose from and describes how to secure your database, both internally and externally. If you have to support a multi-national environment, you will find the chapter on internationalization and localization to be invaluable. You won''t find a more complete guide to PostgreSQL anywhere. The authors have made PostgreSQL approachable by leading the reader from basic concepts to advanced features. Whether you''re a database beginner or an advanced user, you will find this book a valuable addition to your library.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '790', '2003', '4', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gkQVL9pyFVYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'PostgreSQL')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

IOStreams and locales are two such major components for text internationalization. As critical as these two APIs are, however, there are few resources devoted to explaining them.

It provides a comprehensive description of, and reference to, the iostreams and locales classes, showing how to put them to use and offering advanced information on customizing and extending their basic operation. Written by two experts involved with the development of the standard, this book reveals the rationale behind the design of the APIs and points out their potential pitfalls. This book serves as both a guide and a reference to C++ components. Part I explains iostreams, what they are, how they are used, their underlying architectural concepts, and the techniques for extending the iostream framework. Part II introduces internationalization and shows you how to adapt your program to local conventions. Readers seeking an initial overview of the problem domain will find an explanation of what internationalization and localization are, how they are related, and how they differ. With examples, the authors show the differences among cultural conventions, how C++ locales can be used to address such differences, and how locale framework can be extended to handle further, nonstandard cultural conventions. "Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales" Explains formatting and error indication features of iostreams in detail Describes underlying concepts of the iostreams framework Demonstrates implementation of i/o operations for user-defined types Shows techniques for implementing extended stream and stream buffer classes Introduces internationalization Explains how to use standard features for internationalization Demonstrates techniques for implementation of user-defined internationalization services IOStreams and locales serve as a foundation library that provides a number of ready-to-use interfaces, as well as frameworks that can be customized and extended.

Part public theater, part smoke-filled backroom, the Council has enjoyed notable successes and suffered ignominious failures, but it has always provided a space for the five great powers to sit down together. Five to Rule Them All tells the inside story of this remarkable diplomatic creation. Drawing on extensive research, including dozens of interviews with serving and former ambassadors on the Council, the book chronicles political battles and personality clashes as it opens the closed doors of its meeting room. What emerges here is a revealing portrait of the most powerful diplomatic body in the world. When the five permanent members are united, David Bosco points out, the Council can wage war, impose blockades, redraw borders, unseat governments, and levy sanctions. There are almost no limits to its authority. Yet the Council exists in a world of realpolitik. Its members are, above all, powerful states with their own diverging interests. Time and again, the Council''s performance has dashed the hope that its members would somehow work together to establish a more peaceful world. But if these lofty hopes have been unfulfilled, the Council has still served an invaluable purpose: to prevent conflict between the Great Powers. In this role, the Council has been an unheralded success. As Bosco reminds us, massacres in the Balkans and chaos in Iraq are human tragedies, but conflicts between the world''s great powers in the nuclear age would be catastrophic.

The book contains many exercises ranging from simple to miniprojects.Starting with basic set theory, structural operational semantics is introduced as a way to define the meaning of programming languages along with associated proof techniques. Denotational and axiomatic semantics are illustrated on a simple language of while-programs, and fall proofs are given of the equivalence of the operational and denotational semantics and soundness and relative completeness of the axiomatic semantics. A proof of Godel''s incompleteness theorem, which emphasizes the impossibility of achieving a fully complete axiomatic semantics, is included. It is supported by an appendix providing an introduction to the theory of computability based on while-programs.Following a presentation of domain theory, the semantics and methods of proof for several functional languages are treated. The simplest language is that of recursion equations with both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation. This work is extended to lan guages with higher and recursive types, including a treatment of the eager and lazy lambda-calculi. Throughout, the relationship between denotational and operational semantics is stressed, and the proofs of the correspondence between the operation and denotational semantics are provided. The treatment of recursive types - one of the more advanced parts of the book - relies on the use of information systems to represent domains.

We walk on it, drive on it, and many of us live and work within its walls. But very few of us know what it is. We take for granted this ubiquitous substance, which both literally and figuratively comprises much of modern civilization’s constructed environment; yet the story of its creation and development features a cast of fascinating characters and remarkable historical episodes. This book delves into this history, opening readers’ eyes at every turn. In a lively narrative peppered with intriguing details, author Robert Corland describes how some of the most famous personalities of history became involved in the development and use of concrete—including King Herod the Great of Judea, the Roman emperor Hadrian, Thomas Edison (who once owned the largest concrete cement plant in the world), and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Courland points to recent archaeological evidence suggesting that the discovery of concrete directly led to the Neolithic Revolution and the rise of the earliest civilizations. Much later, the Romans reached extraordinarily high standards for concrete production, showcasing their achievement in iconic buildings like the Coliseum and the Pantheon. Amazingly, with the fall of the Roman Empire, the secrets of concrete manufacturing were lost for over a millennium. The author explains that when concrete was rediscovered in the late eighteenth century it was initially viewed as an interesting novelty or, at best, a specialized building material suitable only for a narrow range of applications. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that the use of concrete exploded. During this rapid expansion, industry lobbyists tried to disguise the fact that modern concrete had certain defects and critical shortcomings. It is now recognized that modern concrete, unlike its Roman predecessor, gradually disintegrates with age. Compounding this problem is another distressing fact: the manufacture of concrete cement is a major contributor to global warming. Concrete Planet is filled with incredible stories, fascinating characters, surprising facts, and an array of intriguing insights into the building material that forms the basis of the infrastructure on which we depend.

The series, titled “Dark Alliance,” revealed that for the better part of a decade, a Bay Area drug ring sold tons of cocaine to Los Angeles street gangs and funneled millions in drug profits to the CIA-backed Nicaraguan Contras. Gary Webb pushed his investigation even further in his book, Dark Alliance: The CIA, The Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion. Drawing from then newly declassified documents, undercover DEA audio and videotapes that had never been publicly released, federal court testimony, and interviews, Webb demonstrates how our government knowingly allowed massive amounts of drugs and money to change hands at the expense of our communities. Webb’s own stranger-than-fiction experience is also woven into the book. His excoriation by the media—not because of any wrongdoing on his part, but by an insidious process of innuendo and suggestion that in effect blamed Webb for the implications of the story—had been all but predicted. Webb was warned off doing a CIA expose by a former Associated Press journalist who lost his job when, years before, he had stumbled onto the germ of the “Dark Alliance” story. And though Internal investigations by both the CIA and the Justice Department eventually vindicated Webb, he had by then been pushed out of the Mercury News and gone to work for the California State Legislature Task Force on Government Oversight.

In Bonds of Alliance, Brett Rushforth reveals the dynamics of this system from its origins to the end of French colonial rule. Balancing a vast geographic and chronological scope with careful attention to the lives of enslaved individuals, this book gives voice to those who lived through the ordeal of slavery and, along the way, shaped French and Native societies. Rather than telling a simple story of colonial domination and Native victimization, Rushforth argues that Indian slavery in New France emerged at the nexus of two very different forms of slavery: one indigenous to North America and the other rooted in the Atlantic world. The alliances that bound French and Natives together forced a century-long negotiation over the nature of slavery and its place in early American society. Neither fully Indian nor entirely French, slavery in New France drew upon and transformed indigenous and Atlantic cultures in complex and surprising ways. Based on thousands of French and Algonquian-language manuscripts archived in Canada, France, the United States and the Caribbean, Bonds of Alliance bridges the divide between continental and Atlantic approaches to early American history.

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing--and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship. Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn''t Have to Suck!"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don''t understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security. Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi''s website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully ("Your site summarizes everything I want with my life--to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings," Dan Esparza) and effusively ("Dude, you rock. I love this site!" Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: "Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in" (San Francisco Chronicle).

No lecturing, just help from a friend. And even though money is typically an off-limits conversation, nothing is off-limits here. Lapin rethinks every piece of financial wisdom you''ve ever heard and puts her own fresh, modern, sassy spin on it. Sure, there are some hard-and-fast rules about finance, but when it comes to your money, the only person who can spend it is you. Should you invest in a 401(k)? Maybe not. Should you splurge on that morning latte? Likely yes. Instead of nickel-and-diming yourself, Nicole''s advice focuses on investing in yourself so you don''t have to stress over the little things. But in order to do that, you have to be able to speak the language of money. After all, money is a language like anything else, and the sooner you can join the conversation, the sooner you can live the life you want, RICH BITCH rehabs whatever bad habits you might have and provides a plan you can not only sustain, but thrive with.

For thousands of years we have been making dry fermented sausages without any understanding of the process involved. Only in the past 60 years, sufficient advances were made in the field of meat science which explained the fermentation and drying of meats. Until then, the manufacturing process was shrouded in secrecy, and was more a combination of art and magic than a solid science. Highly technical papers were published in Food Technology journals, unfortunately these works were written in such difficult terms, that they were beyond the comprehension of the average sausage maker.

The residuals are compressed using JPEG 2000 Part 1 by bypassing the wavelet transform, which means that only the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) is used. In addition to controlling the MAE, techniques that minimize the MAE when a bit rate is specified are also described and tested. The proposed algorithms use JPEG 2000 for both, lossy compression of the original data and lossless residual coding. Due to the use of these two compression steps, the overall compression (total bit rate) is a function of two variables, the lossy bit rate and the lossless residual bit rate. For the case of controlling the MAE, two methods that search for the lowest total bit rate based on information obtained at two pivot points (lossy bit rates) are proposed. The results obtained using these techniques are compared with those acquired utilizing an exhaustive search. It will be shown that the pivot-based algorithms yield similar results obtained by using the exhaustive search. For the case of minimizing the MAE when a bit rate is specified, two techniques are developed and tested. The use of the JPEG 2000 quality scalability property is analyzed with regards to solving this same problem. This technique requires some form of bit allocation for the case of 3D data sets. Analysis and results for the methods that minimize the MAE are also included. It will be demonstrated that JPEG 2000 can be used to control the maximum absolute error using model-based techniques that omit the use of an exhaustive search.

Computers have fundamentally changed the nature of work in America. However it is difficult to grasp the full extent of these changes and their implications for the future of business. To begin the long process of understanding the effects of computing in American business, we need to know the history of how computers were first used, by whom and why. In this, the second volume of The Digital Hand, James W. Cortada combines detailed analysis with narrative history to provide a broad overview of computing''s and telecomunications'' role in over a dozen industries, ranging from Old Economy sectors like finance and publishing to New Economy sectors like digital photography and video games. He also devotes considerable attention to the rapidly changing media and entertainment industries which are now some of the most technologically advanced in the American economy. Beginning in 1950, when commercial applications of digital technology began to appear, Cortada examines the ways different industries adopted new technologies, as well as the ways their innovative applications influenced other industries and the US economy as a whole. He builds on the surveys presented in the first volume of the series, which examined sixteen manufacturing, process, transportation, wholesale and retail industries. In addition to this account, of computers'' impact on industries, Cortada also demonstrates how industries themselves influenced the nature of digital technology.

Unlike most histories of computing, it is not a book about machines, inventors, or entrepreneurs. Instead, it tells the story of the vast but largely anonymous legions of computer specialists -- programmers, systems analysts, and other software developers -- who transformed the electronic computer from a scientific curiosity into the defining technology of the modern era. As the systems that they built became increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, these specialists became the focus of a series of critiques of the social and organizational impact of electronic computing. To many of their contemporaries, it seemed the "computer boys" were taking over, not just in the corporate setting, but also in government, politics, and society in general. In The Computer Boys Take Over, Nathan Ensmenger traces the rise to power of the computer expert in modern American society. His rich and nuanced portrayal of the men and women (a surprising number of the "computer boys" were, in fact, female) who built their careers around the novel technology of electronic computing explores issues of power, identity, and expertise that have only become more significant in our increasingly computerized society.In his recasting of the drama of the computer revolution through the eyes of its principle revolutionaries, Ensmenger reminds us that the computerization of modern society was not an inevitable process driven by impersonal technological or economic imperatives, but was rather a creative, contentious, and above all, fundamentally human development.', DEFAULT, '14.74', '336', '2012-08-24', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VCcsTPQ738oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Computer Boys Take Over')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This is about to change thanks to new technology, digital scholarship, and computerized visualization. Text itself has inherent limitations: the very use of words -- their meaning and the connections among them -- shapes and restricts how historians think and communicate ideas. The rise of the computer is radically altering how human beings receive and process information. Digital environments and virtual reality are adding a third dimension to communication and creating a new visual language. This visionary and thoroughly accessible book examines this entire revolutionary phenomenon and how historians will utilize the new medium of computers and the new language of visualization to transform our understanding of history. Drawing on familiar graphic models -- maps, flow charts, museum displays, films -- the author shows how images can often convey ideas and information more efficientyly and accurately than words. With emerging digital technology, these images will become more sophisticated, manipulable, and multidimensional, and provide historians with new tools and environments to construct historical narratives. Just as the transition from prehistoric cave paintings to the spread of literacy changed how people think and process information, so has -- and will -- the computer. Moving beyond the traditional book based on linear narrative, digital scholarship based on visualization and hypertext will offer multiple perspectives, dimensions, and experiences that transform how historians work and how people imagine and learn about history.', DEFAULT, '14.23', DEFAULT, '2002-12-27', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8Ctq0GOh0icC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Computers, Visualization, and History')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The BLT celebrates all that’s right with one of the summer’s simplest sandwiches. And burgers? Well, why have a cheeseburger when you can have a bacon cheeseburger? Building on those red-white-and-blue foundations, author Jennifer L.S. Pearsall has taken all the savory, smoky-sweet goodness that is bacon and elevated its status. Working this succulent cured meat into dishes ranging from comfort to extraordinary, basic to complex, and across the spectrum of breakfast, lunch, appetizers, dinners, and desserts—yes, desserts!—Pearsall has taken the uses of bacon to new heights. As she puts it, “I can’t think of anything bacon doesn’t work with.” There’s just something about it that seems to complement every other food it comes in contact with and across the range of sensations we normally associate with taste—salty, sweet, sour, and bitter. But, during Pearsall’s time in the kitchen putting together this book, she found that bacon also qualifies as umami, that fifth taste sensation that, roughly translated, simply means “good flavor.” Sure, bacon can be a dominant feature in something like a well-topped burger, a place where you really want to taste the bacon as a whole. But dice it fine and work it into a dessert crust, a bread dough, pulled pork, anything, and now you’ve got a dish that just has something.

It also goes a long way to answering the question on everyone''s mind: How long will Harbaugh stay in Ann Arbor?

Bacon takes you inside the offices, the board rooms and the locker rooms of the University of Michigan to see what happened, and why - with countless eye-opening, head-shaking scenes of conflict and conquest. But Endzone is also an inspiring story of redemption and revival. When those who loved Michigan football the most recognized it was being attacked from within, they rallied to reclaim the values that made it great for over a century -- values that went deeper than dollars. The list of heroes includes players, students, lettermen, fans and faculty - and the leaders who had the courage to listen to them. Their unprecedented uprising produced a new athletic director, and a new coach - the hottest in the land - who vindicated the fans'' faith when he turned down more money and fame to return to the place he loved most: Michigan.

Weight loss is not the key to health, diet and exercise are not effective weight-loss strategies and fatness is not a death sentence. You’ve heard it before: there’s a global health crisis, and, unless we make some changes, we’re in trouble. That much is true—but the epidemic is NOT obesity. The real crisis lies in the toxic stigma placed on certain bodies and the impact of living with inequality—not the numbers on a scale. In a mad dash to shrink our bodies, many of us get so caught up in searching for the perfect diet, exercise program, or surgical technique that we lose sight of our original goal: improved health and well-being. Popular methods for weight loss don’t get us there and lead many people to feel like failures when they can’t match unattainable body standards. It’s time for a cease-fire in the war against obesity. Dr. Linda Bacon and Dr. Lucy Aphramor’s Body Respect debunks common myths about weight, including the misconceptions that BMI can accurately measure health, that fatness necessarily leads to disease, and that dieting will improve health. They also help make sense of how poverty and oppression—such as racism, homophobia, and classism—affect life opportunity, self-worth, and even influence metabolism.

It offers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design, presenting an extensive set of design best practices, experience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that facilitate the development of software projects facing complex domains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book incorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to illustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world software development. Readers learn how to use a domain model to make a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core of best practices and standard patterns provides a common language for the development team. A shift in emphasis–refactoring not just the code but the model underlying the code–in combination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads to deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between domain expert and programmer. Domain-Driven Design then builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design for complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics covered include: With this book in hand, object-oriented developers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance they need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful domain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting software implementations.', DEFAULT, '47.39', '560', '2003-08-22', '3', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Domain-Driven Design')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It really is good to have Thomas Pynchon around, doing what he does best.” (Michael Dirda) It is 2001 in New York City, in the lull between the collapse of the dot-com boom and the terrible events of September 11th. Silicon Alley is a ghost town, Web 1.0 is having adolescent angst, Google has yet to IPO, Microsoft is still considered the Evil Empire. There may not be quite as much money around as there was at the height of the tech bubble, but there’s no shortage of swindlers looking to grab a piece of what’s left. Maxine Tarnow is running a nice little fraud investigation business on the Upper West Side, chasing down different kinds of small-scale con artists. She used to be legally certified but her license got pulled a while back, which has actually turned out to be a blessing because now she can follow her own code of ethics—carry a Beretta, do business with sleazebags, hack into people’s bank accounts—without having too much guilt about any of it. Otherwise, just your average working mom—two boys in elementary school, an off-and-on situation with her sort of semi-ex-husband Horst, life as normal as it ever gets in the neighborhood—till Maxine starts looking into the finances of a computer-security firm and its billionaire geek CEO, whereupon things begin rapidly to jam onto the subway and head downtown. She soon finds herself mixed up with a drug runner in an art deco motorboat, a professional nose obsessed with Hitler’s aftershave, a neoliberal enforcer with footwear issues, plus elements of the Russian mob and various bloggers, hackers, code monkeys, and entrepreneurs, some of whom begin to show up mysteriously dead. Foul play, of course. With occasional excursions into the DeepWeb and out to Long Island, Thomas Pynchon, channeling his inner Jewish mother, brings us a historical romance of New York in the early days of the internet, not that distant in calendar time but galactically remote from where we’ve journeyed to since. Will perpetrators be revealed, forget about brought to justice? Will Maxine have to take the handgun out of her purse? Will she and Horst get back together? Will Jerry Seinfeld make an unscheduled guest appearance? Will accounts secular and karmic be brought into balance? Hey. Who wants to know? Slate.com "If not here at the end of history, when? If not Pynchon, who?

To that end, this book and set of tools is organized around the premise that developers will have the following interests and needs: Visio Structure: An organized and comprehensive presentation of Visio''s document and user-interface object models including the all-important ShapeSheet. Browsable Reference Material: There''s lots of info in Visio''s Developer Help, but it will take you forever to digest enough of it to get the big picture. To greatly accelerate the process, this book includes a "browsable" reference section -- objects, properties, methods and shapesheet cells and functions tabulated in an order which brings related items together. You''ll still use Help, but with this book you can rapidly skim over and locate features of interest to your task at hand. Visio Behavior: The power beneath the surface. Work with it, not against it! Investigation of numerous key areas of Visio behavior, at a level which uncovers many subtleties not evident from simply using the product. Solution Architectures for adding functionality to Visio. Several alternative forms are possible. Read why "VSL Addons" are still the preferred form for many kinds of application. VSLs have traditionally required C/C++, Delphi, or some other language capable of working with Automation and producing arbitrary DLLs. Now, using the "VBVSL_Adapter" component available with this book, VSLs can be built easily with Visual Basic. The VBVSL foundation allows the book to use Visual Basic samples to illuminate many more topics of interest to Visio-based application-builders. Several sample applications are supplied which you can copy and modify to get your own addons up and running quickly. Browsing Tools: The book gives you access to download a suite of browsing tools which you can use to instantly clarify exactly what''s going with several of Visio''s more elaborate or arcane features, such as EventLists, UIObjects, CommandBars, browse Visio 2002''s new XML-format files and so on. This will vastly accelerate your learning process, and goes a long way to keep your development efforts on track.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '482', '2001', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8q5RG2CwF5wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Visio 2002 Developer''s Survival Pack')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
