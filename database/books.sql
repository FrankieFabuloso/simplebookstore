The following parts treat the application of regularization methods in gravity and magnetic, electromagnetic, and seismic inverse problems. The key connecting idea of these applied parts of the book is the analogy between the solutions of the forward and inverse problems in different geophysical methods.

This book concentrates on these inverse problems and how they can be usefully introduced to undergraduate students. A historical introduction sets the scene and gives a cultural context for what the rest of the book. Chapters dealing with inverse problems in calculus, differential equations and linear algebra then follow and the book concludes with suggestions for further reading.

Calculating the Weather: Meteorology in the 20th Century explains this transformation by examining thevarious roles of computation throughout the history of meteorology, giving most attention to the period from World War I to the 1960s. The electronic digital computer, a product of World War II, led to great advances in empirical, theoretical, and practical meteorology. At the same time, the use of the computer led to the discovery of so-called"chaotic systems,"and to the recognition that there may well be fundamental limits to predicting the weather.

Fear of diminished credibility motivated America''s costly participation in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and, since the end of the Cold War, this concern has continued to guide American policy decisions. Daryl G. Press uses historical evidence, including declassified documents, to answer two crucial questions: When a country backs down in a crisis, does its credibility suffer? How do leaders assess their adversaries'' credibility? Press illuminates the decision-making processes behind events such as the crises in Europe that preceded World War II, the superpower showdowns over Berlin in the 1950s and 60s, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. When leaders face the prospect of high-stakes military conflicts, Press shows, they do not assess their adversaries'' credibility by peering into their opponents'' past and evaluating their history of keeping or breaking commitments. Power and interests in the current crisis—not past actions—determine the credibility of a threat. Press demonstrates that threats are credible only if backed by sufficient power and only if pursuing important interests. Press believes that Washington''s obsession with the dangers of backing down has made U.S. foreign policy unnecessarily rigid. In every competitive environment—sports, gambling, warfare—competitors use feints and bluffs to tremendous advantage.

The selection, origin and version of the explicit quotations are greatly neglected aspects in previous studies. This quest attempts to address these matters from a tradition historical and a text critical angle. It follows the ground plan of Hebrews'' own presentation of two sets of quotations that are listed in pairs: the first consisting mainly of hymnic texts and the second consisting of quotations from the Torah that are alternated with quotations from the Psalms and the Prophets. The investigation considers each quotation in the light of possible alternative Vorlage(n) to those of the printed versions and interacts with previously proposed hypotheses, such as the Testimony Book, liturgy, homily, and midrash hypotheses. It became clear that, although Hebrews might have known a large number of quotations from the early Jewish and early Christian traditions, he also expanded on some and added some longer quotations. The author himself was responsible for the majority of the combinations of the quotations, although there are traces of the existence of exegetical traditions that combined particular passages prior to his time. The use of Psalms, Odes, hymnic reworkings and compositions of his quoted texts all testify to an interesting inclination towards hymnic tendencies. The study concludes that so-called differences between Hebrews and the LXX could be explained in the light of an alternative Vorlage where the readings of the quotations seem to be closer to an Egyptian text tradition, but also to the author''s own creative hand.', DEFAULT, '174.4', '458', '2011', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QGk5oSoKJDYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A Quest for the Assumed LXX Vorlage of the Explicit Quotations in Hebrews')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Therefore, it has a natural connection to the philosophy of language. Central issues of this connection, however, lack a clear answer. For instance, how much freedom do judges have in applying the law? How are the literal and the purposive approaches related to one another? How can we distinguish between applying the law and making the law?This book provides answers by means of a complex and detailed theory of literal meaning. A new legal method is introduced, namely the further development of the law. It is so far unknown in Anglo-American jurisprudence, but it is shown that this new method helps in solving some of the most crucial puzzles in jurisprudence.At its centre the book addresses legal indeterminism and refutes linguistic-philosophical reasons for indeterminacy. It spells out the normative character of interpretation as emphasized by Raz and, with the help of Robert Brandom''s normative pragmatics, it is shown that the relativism of interpretation from a normative perspective does not at all justify scepticism. On the contrary, it supports the claim that legal argumentation can be objective, and maintains that statements on the meaning of a statute can be right or wrong, and take on inter-subjective validity accordingly. This book breaks new ground in transferring Brandom''s philosophy to legal theoretical problems and presents an original and exciting analysis of the semantic argument in legal argumentation. It was the recipient of the European Award for Legal Theory in 2002.''This book represents, on the one hand, a reception of Robert Brandom''s important theory including applications of this theory in the field of legal philosophy and, on the other, an exploration of the limits of an appeal in legal interpretation to the text.

General equilibrium models form a convenient context for analyzing such alternative government policies.

This book describes some general equilibrium models that are dynamic, that have been built to help interpret time-series of observations of economic aggregates and to predict the consequences of alternative government interventions. The first part of the book describes dynamic programming, search theory, and real dynamic capital pricing models. Among the applications are stochastic optimal growth models, matching models, arbitrage pricing theories, and theories of interest rates, stock prices, and options. The remaining parts of the book are devoted to issues in monetary theory; currency-in-utility-function models, cash-in-advance models, Townsend turnpike models, and overlapping generations models are all used to study a set of common issues. By putting these models to work on concrete problems in exercises offered throughout the text, Sargent provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these models of money.

It’s a cookbook,” he says and opens to some recipes, with color photos. “I want to prepare you, very much.” This isn’t just about getting me hot till my juices run clear, and then a little rest.

Something delicious. So begins the adventures of Miss Chicken, a young free-range, from raw innocence to golden brown ecstasy, in this spoof-in-a-cookbook that simmers in the afterglow of E.L. James’s sensational Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. Like Anastasia Steele, Miss Chicken finds herself at the mercy of a dominating man, in this case, a wealthy, sexy, and very hungry chef.

SPRING CHICKEN: Stay Young Forever (or Die Trying) SPRING CHICKEN is a full-throttle, high-energy ride through the latest research, popular mythology, and ancient wisdom on mankind''s oldest obsession: How can we live longer? And better? In his funny, self-deprecating voice, veteran reporter Bill Gifford takes readers on a fascinating journey through the science of aging, from the obvious signs like wrinkles and baldness right down into the innermost workings of cells. We visit cutting-edge labs where scientists are working to "hack" the aging process, like purging "senescent" cells from mice to reverse the effects of aging. He''ll reveal why some people live past 100 without even trying, what has happened with resveratrol, the "red wine pill" that made headlines a few years ago, how your fat tissue is trying to kill you, and how it''s possible to unlock longevity-promoting pathways that are programmed into our very genes. Gifford separates the wheat from the chaff as he exposes hoaxes and scams foisted upon an aging society, and arms readers with the best possible advice on what to do, what not to do, and what life-changing treatments may be right around the corner. An intoxicating mixture of deep reporting, fascinating science, and prescriptive takeaway, SPRING CHICKEN will reveal the extraordinary breakthroughs that may yet bring us eternal youth, while exposing dangerous deceptions that prey on the innocent and ignorant.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '368', '2015-02-17', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PrqFBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Spring Chicken')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

In a masterful combination of historical sleuthing and journalistic adventure, veteran reporter Andrew Lawler “opens a window on civilization, evolution, capitalism, and ethics” (New York) with a fascinating account of the most successful of all cross-species relationships—the partnership between human and chicken. This “splendid book full of obsessive travel and research in history” (Kirkus Reviews) explores how people through the ages embraced the chicken as a messenger of the gods, an all-purpose medicine, an emblem of resurrection, a powerful sex symbol, a gambling aid, a handy research tool, an inspiration for bravery, the epitome of evil, and, of course, the star of the world’s most famous joke. Queen Victoria was obsessed with the chicken. Socrates’s last words embraced it. Charles Darwin and Louis Pasteur used it for scientific breakthroughs. Religious leaders of all stripes have praised it. Now neuroscientists are uncovering signs of a deep intelligence that offers insights into human behavior. Trekking from the jungles of southeast Asia through the Middle East and beyond, Lawler discovers the secrets behind the fowl’s transformation from a shy, wild bird into an animal of astonishing versatility, capable of serving our species’ changing needs more than the horse, cow, or dog.

Being a man or a woman in your early sixties is different than it was a generation or two ago, at least for the more fortunate of us. We aren’t old…yet. But we sense it coming: Careers are winding down, kids are gone, parents are dying (friends, too), and our bodies are no longer youthful or even middle-aged. Learning to play tennis in your fifties is no small feat, but becoming a serious, competitive tennis player at the age of sixty is a whole other matter. It requires training the body to defy age, and to methodically build one’s game—the strokework, footwork, strategy, and mental toughness. Gerry Mazorati started playing the game seriously in his mid-fifties. He had the strong desire to lead an examined physical life, to push his body into the “encore” of middle age. In Late to the Ball Mazorati writes vividly about the difficulties, frustrations, and the triumphs of his becoming a seriously good tennis player. He takes on his quest with complete vigor and absolute determination to see it through, providing a rich, vicarious experience involving the science of aging, his existential battle with time, and the beautiful, mysterious game of tennis. Late to the Ball is also captivating evidence that the rest of the Baby Boomer generation, now between middle age and old age, can find their own quest and do the same.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '288', '2016-05-17', '6', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g08JCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Late to the Ball')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Gaul offers a riveting and sometimes shocking look inside the money culture of college football and how it has come to dominate a surprising number of colleges and universities. Over the past decade college football has not only doubled in size, but its elite programs have become a $2.5-billion-a-year entertainment business, with lavishly paid coaches, lucrative television deals, and corporate sponsors eager to slap their logos on everything from scoreboards to footballs and uniforms. Profit margins among the top football schools range from 60% to 75%—results that dwarf those of such high-profile companies as Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft—yet thanks to the support of their football-mad representatives in Congress, teams aren’t required to pay taxes. In most cases, those windfalls are not passed on to the universities themselves, but flow directly back into their athletic departments. College presidents have been unwilling or powerless to stop a system that has spawned a wildly profligate infrastructure of coaches, trainers, marketing gurus, and a growing cadre of bureaucrats whose sole purpose is to ensure that players remain academically eligible to play. From the University of Oregon’s lavish $42 million academic center for athletes to Alabama coach Nick Saban’s $7 million paycheck—ten times what the school pays its president, and 70 times what a full-time professor there earns—Gaul examines in depth the extraordinary financial model that supports college football and the effect it has had not only on other athletic programs but on academic ones as well. What are the consequences when college football coaches are the highest paid public employees in over half the states in an economically troubled country, or when football players at some schools receive ten times the amount of scholarship awards that academically gifted students do? Billion-Dollar Ball considers these and many other issues in a compelling account of how an astonishingly wealthy sports franchise has begun to reframe campus values and distort the fundamental academic mission of our universities.

The decision to host this year’s premier meeting in Beijing reflects the Society’s successful transition from its traditional European focus to a truly global organization, with 24% of SGA members situated in North America, 13% in Australia and Oceania, and 5% in Asia. Over the last 27 years China has made dramatic progress towards political and economic reform, and opening the nation to the outside world.

While Alec Ross was working as Senior Advisor for Innovation to the Secretary of State, he traveled to forty-one countries, exploring the latest advances coming out of every continent. From startup hubs in Kenya to R&D labs in South Korea, Ross has seen what the future holds. In The Industries of the Future, Ross shows us what changes are coming in the next ten years, highlighting the best opportunities for progress and explaining why countries thrive or sputter. He examines the specific fields that will most shape our economic future, including robotics, cybersecurity, the commercialization of genomics, the next step for big data, and the coming impact of digital technology on money and markets. In each of these realms, Ross addresses the toughest questions: How will we adapt to the changing nature of work? Is the prospect of cyberwar sparking the next arms race? How can the world’s rising nations hope to match Silicon Valley in creating their own innovation hotspots? And what can today’s parents do to prepare their children for tomorrow? Ross blends storytelling and economic analysis to give a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live. Incorporating the insights of leaders ranging from tech moguls to defense experts, The Industries of the Future takes the intimidating, complex topics that many of us know to be important and boils them down into clear, plainspoken language.

In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku—the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible—gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world’s top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics. In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world''s information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism. Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically. In space, radically new ships—needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion—could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth’s atmosphere at the push of a button. But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper? All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.

It emphasizes the basic principles, and aims to progress rapidly to the point of being able to handle physically and mathematically interesting problems, without getting bogged down in excessive formalism. Lagrangian methods are introduced at a relatively early stage, to get students to appreciate their use in simple contexts. Later chapters use Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods extensively, but in a way that aims to be accessible to undergraduates, while including modern developments at the appropriate level of detail. The subject has been developed considerably recently while retaining a truly central role for all students of physics and applied mathematics.This edition retains all the main features of the fourth edition, including the two chapters on geometry of dynamical systems and on order and chaos, and the new appendices on conics and on dynamical systems near a critical point. The material has been somewhat expanded, in particular to contrast continuous and discrete behaviours. A further appendix has been added on routes to chaos (period-doubling) and related discrete maps.

It is intended to provide a thorough coverage of the fundamental principles and techniques of classical mechanics, an old subject that is at the base of all of physics, but in which there has also in recent years been rapid development. The book is aimed at undergraduate students of physics and applied mathematics. It emphasizes the basic principles, and aims to progress rapidly to the point of being able to handle physically and mathematically interesting problems, without getting bogged down in excessive formalism. Lagrangian methods are introduced at a relatively early stage, to get students to appreciate their use in simple contexts. Later chapters use Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods extensively, but in a way that aims to be accessible to undergraduates, while including modern developments at the appropriate level of detail. The subject has been developed considerably recently while retaining a truly central role for all students of physics and applied mathematics.This edition retains all the main features of the fourth edition, including the two chapters on geometry of dynamical systems and on order and chaos, and the new appendices on conics and on dynamical systems near a critical point. The material has been somewhat expanded, in particular to contrast continuous and discrete behaviours. A further appendix has been added on routes to chaos (period-doubling) and related discrete maps. The new edition has also been revised to give more emphasis to specific examples worked out in detail.Classical Mechanics is written for undergraduate students of physics or applied mathematics.

When Horowitz began his odyssey, the left had already escaped the political ghetto to which his parents'' generation and his own had been confined. Today, it has become the dominant force in America''s academic and media cultures, electing a president and achieving a position from which it can shape America''s future. How it achieved its present success and what that success portends are the overarching subjects of Horowitz''s conservative writings. Through the unflinching focus of one singularly engaged witness, the identity of a destructive movement that constantly morphs itself in order to conceal its identity and mission becomes disturbingly clear.

Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro''s groundbreaking research analyzes wealth - total assets and debts rather than income alone - to uncover deep and persistent racial inequality in America, and they show how public policies have failed to redress the problem. First published in 1995, Black Wealth / White Wealth is considered a classic exploration of race and inequality. It provided, for the first time, systematic empirical evidence that explained the racial inequality gap between blacks and whites. The Tenth Anniversary edition contains two entirely new and substantive chapters. These chapters look at the continuing issues of wealth and inequality in America and the new policies that have been launched in the past ten years. Some have been progressive while others only recreate inequality - for example the proposal to eliminate the estate tax. Compelling and also informative, Black Wealth / White Wealth is not just pioneering research. It is also a powerful counterpoint to arguments against affirmative action and a direct challenge to current social welfare policies that are tilted towards the wealthy.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '338', '2006', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ksJuX02DNwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Black Wealth, White Wealth')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Being a man or a woman in your early sixties is different than it was a generation or two ago, at least for the more fortunate of us. We aren’t old…yet. But we sense it coming: Careers are winding down, kids are gone, parents are dying (friends, too), and our bodies are no longer youthful or even middle-aged. Learning to play tennis in your fifties is no small feat, but becoming a serious, competitive tennis player at the age of sixty is a whole other matter. It requires training the body to defy age, and to methodically build one’s game—the strokework, footwork, strategy, and mental toughness. Gerry Mazorati started playing the game seriously in his mid-fifties. He had the strong desire to lead an examined physical life, to push his body into the “encore” of middle age. In Late to the Ball Mazorati writes vividly about the difficulties, frustrations, and the triumphs of his becoming a seriously good tennis player. He takes on his quest with complete vigor and absolute determination to see it through, providing a rich, vicarious experience involving the science of aging, his existential battle with time, and the beautiful, mysterious game of tennis. Late to the Ball is also captivating evidence that the rest of the Baby Boomer generation, now between middle age and old age, can find their own quest and do the same.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '288', '2016-05-17', '6', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=g08JCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Late to the Ball')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Gaul offers a riveting and sometimes shocking look inside the money culture of college football and how it has come to dominate a surprising number of colleges and universities. Over the past decade college football has not only doubled in size, but its elite programs have become a $2.5-billion-a-year entertainment business, with lavishly paid coaches, lucrative television deals, and corporate sponsors eager to slap their logos on everything from scoreboards to footballs and uniforms. Profit margins among the top football schools range from 60% to 75%—results that dwarf those of such high-profile companies as Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft—yet thanks to the support of their football-mad representatives in Congress, teams aren’t required to pay taxes. In most cases, those windfalls are not passed on to the universities themselves, but flow directly back into their athletic departments. College presidents have been unwilling or powerless to stop a system that has spawned a wildly profligate infrastructure of coaches, trainers, marketing gurus, and a growing cadre of bureaucrats whose sole purpose is to ensure that players remain academically eligible to play. From the University of Oregon’s lavish $42 million academic center for athletes to Alabama coach Nick Saban’s $7 million paycheck—ten times what the school pays its president, and 70 times what a full-time professor there earns—Gaul examines in depth the extraordinary financial model that supports college football and the effect it has had not only on other athletic programs but on academic ones as well. What are the consequences when college football coaches are the highest paid public employees in over half the states in an economically troubled country, or when football players at some schools receive ten times the amount of scholarship awards that academically gifted students do? Billion-Dollar Ball considers these and many other issues in a compelling account of how an astonishingly wealthy sports franchise has begun to reframe campus values and distort the fundamental academic mission of our universities.

Furthermore, the knowledge offered by this book into the fundamentals of these computer systems can benefit anyone who has to evaluate and apply the systems.The second edition of Designing Embedded Hardware has been updated to include information on the latest generation of processors and microcontrollers, including the new MAXQ processor. If you''re new to this and don''t know what a MAXQ is, don''t worry--the book spells out the basics of embedded design for beginners while providing material useful for advanced systems designers.Designing Embedded Hardware steers a course between those books dedicated to writing code for particular microprocessors, and those that stress the philosophy of embedded system design without providing any practical information.

Cryptography is a milliner science that was the key to the secret of ancient Rome and a fundamental piece in the Second World War. Today, it is a star in the computation world. Several operating systems, data base systems or simple filling systems provide the user with cryptographic functions that allow controlled data scrambling. Modern cryptology, which is the basis of information security techniques, started in the late 1970''s and developed in the 1980''s. As communication networks were spreading deep into society, the need for secure communication greatly promoted cryptographic research. The need for fast but secure cryptographic systems is growing bigger. Therefore, dedicated hardware for cryptography is becoming a key issue for designers. With the spread of reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs, hardware implementations of cryptographic algorithms became cost-effective. The focus of this book is on all aspects of cryptographic hardware and embedded systems. This includes design, implementation and security of such systems.

One of the main reasons for this change is the pressure to shorten time-to-market when designing digital systems. To shorten the product cycles, programmable processes are used to implement more and more functionality of the embedded system. Therefore, nowadays, embedded systems are very often implemented by heterogeneous systems consisting of ASICs, processors, memories and peripherals. As a consequence, the research topic of hardware/software co-design, dealing with the problems of designing these heterogeneous systems, has gained great importance. Hardware/Software Co-design for Data Flow Dominated Embedded Systems introduces the different tasks of hardware/software co-design including system specification, hardware/software partitioning, co-synthesis and co-simulation. The book summarizes and classifies state-of-the-art co-design tools and methods for these tasks. In addition, the co-design tool COOL is presented which solves the co-design tasks for the class of data-flow dominated embedded systems. In Hardware/Software Co-design for Data Flow Dominated Embedded Systems the primary emphasis has been put on the hardware/software partitioning and the co-synthesis phase and their coupling. In contrast to many other publications in this area, a mathematical formulation of the hardware/software partitioning problem is given. This problem formulation supports target architectures consisting of multiple processors and multiple ASICs. Several novel approaches are presented and compared for solving the partitioning problem, including an MILP approach, a heuristic solution and an approach based on genetic algorithms. The co-synthesis phase is based on the idea of controlling the system by means of a static run-time scheduler implemented in hardware. New algorithms are introduced which generate a complete set of hardware and software specifications required to implement heterogeneous systems. All of these techniques are described in detail and exemplified. Hardware/Software Co-design for Data Flow Dominated Embedded Systems is intended to serve students and researchers working on hardware/software co-design. At the same time the variety of presented techniques automating the design tasks of hardware/software systems will be of interest to industrial engineers and designers of digital systems.

Chris Guthrie and her son, Ewan, have come to the industrial town of Duncairn, where life is as hard as the granite of the buildings all around them. These are the Depression years of the 1930s, and Chris is far from the fields of her youth in Sunset Song. In a society of factory owners, shopkeepers, policemen, petty clerks and industrial labourers, ‘Chris Caledonia’ must make her living as bets she can by working in Ma Cleghorn’s boarding house. Ewan finds employment in a steel foundry and tries to lead a peaceful strike against the manufacture of armaments.

Founded in 1802, its first and only mission is to prepare young men—and, since 1976, young women—to be leaders of character for service as commissioned officers in the United States Army. West Point’s success in accomplishing that mission has secured its reputation as the foremost leadership-development institution in the world.

First published in 1949, Genesis of a Music is the manifesto of Partch''s radical compositional practice and instruments (which owe nothing to the 300-year-old European tradition of Western music.) He contrasts Abstract and Corporeal music, proclaiming the latter as the vital, emotionally tactile form derived from the spoken word (like Greek, Chinese, Arabic, and Indian musics) and surveys the history of world music at length from this perspective.

At its high, customer loyalty connotes the high entry barriers the competitor faces when entering the market, and it contributes significantly to a reduction of marketing costs. To attract new customers, companies are required to invest a lot of time and money which can result in uncertainties and risks over longer periods of time. The number of loyal customers as a sign of market share is more significant than the total number of customers. More loyal customers translate to high profits. Loyal customers will continue to purchase or receive the product or service from the same enterprises, and they will be willing to pay higher prices for the quality products and first-class services, thereby increasing sales revenue. Consequently, the focus of many enterprise managers at this point is on marketing management aspects to improve customer loyalty in order to gain the competitive advantage in the face of fierce competition. The importance of customer loyalty has been identified by many researchers and academics in the past years. This importance is also predominant in the telecommunication industry and, consequently, the Nigerian telecom industry. This book attempts to assess and analyze the variables that influence a mobile phone subscriber?s loyalty and how Nigerian service providers can enhance this loyalty. The study is based on a survey that uses the quantitative approach. A structured questionnaire was developed and personally administered to a sample of University of Ilorin students across four major GSM operators in the country. Four hundred (400) respondents were sampled through a stratified random sampling. Out of this, three hundred and forty-eight (348) copies of the questionnaire, constituting an 87% response rate, could be used for the analysis. Of the eleven (11) operational factors that were used to assess loyalty of customers in the Nigeria Mobile Telecoms industry, all variables except Brand Image and Service Centre Quality were found to be capable of influencing customer loyalty and also considered as the most important loyalty variables in the industry. The unavailability of Mobile Number Portability was found to be a prominent factor in tying consumers down to service providers, while the generally low satisfaction with the present state of service delivery in the industry also plays a role. Therefore, the retention which the service providers were able to enjoy can be described as circumstantial. The given recommendations include that the service providers embark upon drives that will reduce dropped calls to a bare minimum, that they improve call quality, and that they develop SMS delivery standards.', DEFAULT, '43.44', '72', '2012-11', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v90hcj69PuIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Mobile Telecommunication Customer Loyalty in Nigeria: Determining Factors')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Larry Virgil skipped out on his latest court date after he was arrested for hijacking an eighteen-wheeler full of premium bourbon. Fortunately for bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, Larry is just stupid enough to attempt almost the exact same crime again. Only this time he flees the scene, leaving behind a freezer truck loaded with Bogart ice cream and a dead body—frozen solid and covered in chocolate and chopped pecans. As fate would have it, Stephanie’s mentor and occasional employer, Ranger, needs her to go undercover at the Bogart factory to find out who’s putting their employees on ice and sabotaging the business. It’s going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It’s also going to be hard to explain to Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger, late nights with Lula and Randy Briggs—who are naked and afraid—and late nights keeping tabs on Grandma Mazur and her new fella. Stephanie Plum has a lot on her plate, but for a girl who claims to have “virtually no marketable skills,” these are the kinds of sweet assignments she does best.', DEFAULT, '14.99', '304', '2016-11-15', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AfBxCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Turbo Twenty-Three')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Stephanie Plum might not be the world’s greatest bounty hunter, but she knows when she’s being played. Ken Globovic (aka Gobbles), hailed as the Supreme Exalted Zookeeper of the animal house known as Zeta fraternity, has been arrested for beating up the dean of students at Kiltman College. Gobbles has missed his court date and gone into hiding. People have seen him on campus, but no one will talk. Things just aren’t adding up, and Stephanie can’t shake the feeling that something funny is going on at the college—and it’s not just Zeta fraternity pranks. As much as people love Gobbles, they hate Doug Linken. When Linken is gunned down in his backyard it’s good riddance, and the list of possible murder suspects is long. The only people who care about finding Linken’s killer are Trenton cop Joe Morelli, who has been assigned the case, security expert Ranger, who was hired to protect Linken, and Stephanie, who has her eye on a cash prize and hopefully has some tricks up her sleeve.', DEFAULT, '8.99', '304', '2015-11-17', '3', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUqwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Tricky Twenty-Two')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Watch out, world. Here comes Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie''s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She''s a product of the "burg," a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Now Stephanie''s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad''s, doing her best to sever the world''s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler, and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, fearless bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli is also the irresistible macho pig who took Stephanie''s virginity at age sixteen and then wrote the details on the bathroom wall of Mario''s Sub Shop. There''s still powerful chemistry between these two, so the chase should be interesting. It could also be extremely dangerous, especially when Stephanie encounters a heavyweight title contender who likes to play rough. Benito Ramirez is known for his brutality to women.

But it has its problems. In fact, the vertical design all but guarantees fragmented tasks, overspecialization, fiefdoms, turf wars, the urge to control from the top--all the negatives that foster organizational paralysis. In The Horizontal Organization, Frank Ostroff provides executives with the first truly viable alternative to the age-old vertical alignment. Indeed, he offers nothing less than the first full view of what the organization of the future looks like and how it works. The concept of horizontal organization has been hailed in Fortune as "a model corporation for the next fifty years" and in a Business Week cover story as "the real thing." But until now, management books have offered only piecemeal accounts of what the organization of the future might look like. Ostroff, a key developer of the concept of the horizontal organization, offers the first workable road map. He describes what the horizontal organization is, what it looks like, why it is important, how it helps improve performance, where it is appropriate, and how to develop it. The book contains real case examples that show how major international corporations (and one federal agency) have used Ostroff''s concepts to meet their competitive goals. For instance, we see how Ford Motor Company''s Customer Service Division turned to the horizontal organization to meet a highly ambitious goal--to get the customer''s car fixed right, on time, the first time, at a competitive price, in convenient locations. We see how a horizontal design radically improved the performance of OSHA (the federal agency that oversees occupational safety), transforming it from a bureaucratic enforcer of regulations to a proactive problem-solver in a concerted effort to improve working conditions and save lives. And we see how Xerox combined both vertical and horizontal designs successfully, a case that underscores when a firm can best use the horizontal organization to achieve their goals. Ostroff also looks at a General Electric plant in North Carolina, Motorola''s Space and Systems Technology Group, and the home finance division of Barclays Bank, highlighting how these major corporations have also used the horizontal organization to radically improve productivity. Many successful business books, such as Reengineering the Corporation and Beyond Reengineering, have given managers only a piece of the puzzle. Ostroff gives us the complete picture. The Horizontal Organization offers the first usable roadmap to the twenty-first-century firm.

Constructed wetland treatment systems are engineered systems that have been designed and constructed to utilize the natural processes for removal of pollutants. They are designed to take advantage of many of the same processes that occur in natural wetlands, but do so within a more controlled environment.

Lerman has been described by the Washington Post as “the source of an epochal revolution in the scope and purposes of dance art.” Here, she combines broad outlooks on culture and society with practical applications and accessible stories. Her expansive scope encompasses the craft, structure, and inspiration that bring theatrical works to life as well as the applications of art in fields as diverse as faith, aging, particle physics, and human rights law.

This way, the torsional action of the muscles is saved. A weakening of the horizontal rectus muscles was systematically added, making it a simultaneous horizontal and cyclovertical surgery.

Now that it is possible to make packaging that can detect and inform consumers of contamination, as well as prevent or reduce the growth of human foodborne pathogens, the food packaging and safety industry needs a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-science and future directions of this widely important field. Drawing on the research of a diverse group of scientists and pioneers in the field, Intelligent and Active Packaging for Fruits and Vegetables explores the new technology and applications used to bring fresh, safe, nutritious produce to the consumer. It explains Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) and its use in packaging fruits and vegetables, as well as, fish and meat. It includes variations and advances on MAP such as high vapor-permeable films, and demonstrates modeling techniques to assist in the prediction and selection of packaging type. The book contains a chapter on the trends, opportunities, and challenges of RFID temperature monitoring in food packaging. It also considers the interaction between container and food product, as well as the use of non-toxic insect repellent plastics. There is a chapter on the regulatory implications of the use of nanotechnology in food packaging. Finally, the book discusses consumer perception, the specific needs of developing countries, and current implementation in Europe. Explaining the very latest in packaging technology and opening areas for future research, Intelligent and Active Packaging for Fruits and Vegetables provides an excellent knowledge base from which to revolutionize the delivery of safe and nutritious food.', DEFAULT, '194.4', '360', '2007-07-18', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q2KOOtgKi48C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Intelligent and Active Packaging for Fruits and Vegetables')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

From Bloodshed to Hope in Burundi is a compelling eyewitness account of both a horrific and persistent genocide and of the ongoing efforts of many courageous individuals to build a more just society. Krueger and his wife Kathleen graphically document the slaughter occurring all around them, as well as their repeated efforts to get the U.S. government and the international community to take notice and take action.

The Nordic donor agencies have traditionally concentrated their development assistance in the fields of health, water supply and sanitation to rural areas. In a longer term perspective the authors see three main policy options for the development assistance in these fields: 1. continued concentration on rural programmes ; 2. continued strong support to rural development programmes, combined with an increased involvement in small and medium-sized towns; and 3. involvement in pure urban projects, also in large cities. They recommend that development efforts over the next decade should continue to give priority to rural development. In most sub-Saharan countries 70-90% of the population is rural. Even with current rapid urbanization rates this rural population will go on increasing for the next 30 years. Besides, rural Africa''s health and hygiene problems are still largely unsolved: much remains to be done to increase the coverage, improve the functioning and generate sustainabil-ity of rural water supplies, most remains to be done on rural sanitation and virtually nothing has been done regarding control of disease vectors.

Our brains exist as historical products, developing in interaction with themselves and with their surroundings.Hence there is a thin line between the organization of the nervous system and the political and social organization that both conditions and is conditioned by human experience. Looking carefully at contemporary neuroscience, it is hard not to notice that the new way of talking about the brain mirrors the management discourse of the neo-liberal capitalist world in which we now live, with its talk of decentralization, networks, and flexibility. Consciously or unconsciously, science cannot but echo the world in which it takes place.In the neo-liberal world, "plasticity" can be equated with "flexibility"--a term that has become a buzzword in economics and management theory. The plastic brain would thus represent just another style of power, which, although less centralized, is still a means of control. In this book, Catherine Malabou develops a second, more radical meaning for plasticity. Not only does plasticity allow our brains to adapt to existing circumstances, it opens a margin of freedom to intervene, to change those very circumstances. Such an understanding opens up a newly transformative aspect of the neurosciences.In insisting on this proximity between the neurosciences and the social sciences, Malabou applies to the brain Marx''s well-known phrase about history: people make their own brains, but they do not know it.

How are flexibility and lifelong learning positioned within policy? Flexibility and lifelong learning have become key aspects of education policy in nation states and bodies such as the European Union and Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development in recent years. They are positioned as necessary for the knowledge economy and social inclusion. The failure to adapt through becoming more flexible and participating in lifelong learning is held up as a failure at individual, organisational and national levels. But how has that narrative come to be constructed? In what ways is it persuasive? And what forms of political action are possible and necessary? These are the questions addressed in this text. Drawing upon the work of Michel Foucault and on the notion of rhetoric, this book forensically explores examples of the work of policy texts in the discourses of education, lifelong learning and flexibility that they construct. In so doing, it argues for the need to take policy discourse seriously and not simply dismiss it as ‘spin’. Through a detailed examination of policy texts from primarily Australia, the UK and European Union, this text provides insights into the strategies through which flexibility and lifelong learning become realized and realizable as part of the common sense of educational discourse. Rather than simply rejecting these ideas, or suggesting they are merely the window dressing for the more malign interests of the knowledge economy or globalization, it suggests a politics of the wedge and possibilities for the insertion of different meanings.

The authors assume a background in elementary linear algebra and knowledge of rudimentary analytical concepts. They begin with a review and discussion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The following chapters each treat a major topic in depth. This volume should be useful not only as a text, but also as a self-contained reference work to a variety of audiences in other scientific fields.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '561', '1990-02-23', '7', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PlYQN0ypTwEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Matrix Analysis')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It is also a subject of great mathematical beauty. In consequence of both of these facts, linear algebra has increasingly been brought into lower levels of the curriculum, either in conjunction with the calculus or separate from it but at the same level. A large and still growing number of textbooks has been written to satisfy this need, aimed at students at the junior, sophomore, or even freshman levels. Thus, most students now obtaining a bachelor''s degree in the sciences or engineering have had some exposure to linear algebra. But rarely, even when solid courses are taken at the junior or senior levels, do these students have an adequate working knowledge of the subject to be useful in graduate work or in research and development activities in government and industry. In particular, most elementary courses stop at the point of canonical forms, so that while the student may have "seen" the Jordan and other canonical forms, there is usually little appreciation of their usefulness. And there is almost never time in the elementary courses to deal with more specialized topics like nonnegative matrices, inertia theorems, and so on.

An author whose works have appeared in many languages, Eco is also the translator of Gérard de Nerval''s Sylvie and Raymond Queneau''s Exercices de style from French into Italian. In Experiences in Translation he draws on his substantial practical experience to identify and discuss some central problems of translation. As he convincingly demonstrates, a translation can express an evident deep sense of a text even when violating both lexical and referential faithfulness. Depicting translation as a semiotic task, he uses a wide range of source materials as illustration: the translations of his own and other novels, translations of the dialogue of American films into Italian, and various versions of the Bible. In the second part of his study he deals with translation theories proposed by Jakobson, Steiner, Peirce, and others. Overall, Eco identifies the different types of interpretive acts that count as translation.

The study reviews the various types of payment practices that exist in mature systems including cash, check, GIRO, debit and credit card, direct debit, and large-value wire transfers. A range of short- and long-term improvements in payment systems are recommended for developing countries.

Now that it is possible to make packaging that can detect and inform consumers of contamination, as well as prevent or reduce the growth of human foodborne pathogens, the food packaging and safety industry needs a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-science and future directions of this widely important field. Drawing on the research of a diverse group of scientists and pioneers in the field, Intelligent and Active Packaging for Fruits and Vegetables explores the new technology and applications used to bring fresh, safe, nutritious produce to the consumer. It explains Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) and its use in packaging fruits and vegetables, as well as, fish and meat. It includes variations and advances on MAP such as high vapor-permeable films, and demonstrates modeling techniques to assist in the prediction and selection of packaging type. The book contains a chapter on the trends, opportunities, and challenges of RFID temperature monitoring in food packaging. It also considers the interaction between container and food product, as well as the use of non-toxic insect repellent plastics. There is a chapter on the regulatory implications of the use of nanotechnology in food packaging. Finally, the book discusses consumer perception, the specific needs of developing countries, and current implementation in Europe.

The authors introduce a new way to measure bypassing using the patients'' own knowledge of alternative health providers available to them instead of assuming that information as previously done. The authors analyze how perceived health care quality and prices impact patients'' bypassing decisions. The analysis uses data from a Quantitative Service Delivery Survey in Chad''s health sector carried out in 2004. The survey covers 281 primary health care centers and 1,801 patients. The matching of facility data and patient data allows the analysis to control for a wide range of important patient and facility characteristics, such as income, severity of illness, quality of health care, or price of services. The findings show that income inequalities translate into health service inequalities. There is evidence of two distinct types of bypassing activities in Chad: (1) patients from low-income households bypass high-quality facilities they cannot afford to go to low-quality facilities, and (2) rich individuals bypass low-quality facilities and aim for more expensive facilities that also offer a higher quality of care. These significant differences in patients'' facility choices are observed across income groups as well as between rural and urban areas.', DEFAULT, '0', '40', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lVKCcP-xA0sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Bypassing Health Providers: The Quest for Better Price and Quality of Health Care in Chad')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

When split off from fundamental psychological needs, such actions often do much more harm than good.

Considering these bodies of literature in conjunction with each other is important, as the ways that transgender activists push conversations around binary gender construction can serve as valuable model for activists concerned with addressing actual, lived realities outside of theory. Further, the challenges transgender bodies pose to both feminist and queer theories demonstrates the pressing need to constantly re-evaluate theories of sex and gender as they relate to embodied experiences. Ultimately, I will propose a new theoretical paradigm, a feminist politics of transgression, which will bring together the work of feminists, queer theorists, and transgender activists in the hopes of providing a platform for more effective collaboration.

The residuals are compressed using JPEG 2000 Part 1 by bypassing the wavelet transform, which means that only the embedded block coding with optimized truncation (EBCOT) is used. In addition to controlling the MAE, techniques that minimize the MAE when a bit rate is specified are also described and tested. The proposed algorithms use JPEG 2000 for both, lossy compression of the original data and lossless residual coding. Due to the use of these two compression steps, the overall compression (total bit rate) is a function of two variables, the lossy bit rate and the lossless residual bit rate. For the case of controlling the MAE, two methods that search for the lowest total bit rate based on information obtained at two pivot points (lossy bit rates) are proposed. The results obtained using these techniques are compared with those acquired utilizing an exhaustive search. It will be shown that the pivot-based algorithms yield similar results obtained by using the exhaustive search. For the case of minimizing the MAE when a bit rate is specified, two techniques are developed and tested. The use of the JPEG 2000 quality scalability property is analyzed with regards to solving this same problem. This technique requires some form of bit allocation for the case of 3D data sets. Analysis and results for the methods that minimize the MAE are also included. It will be demonstrated that JPEG 2000 can be used to control the maximum absolute error using model-based techniques that omit the use of an exhaustive search.

A violinist by training, Judson became manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1915 under the iconic conductor Leopold Stokowski. Within a few years, Judson also took on management of the New York Philharmonic, navigating a period of change and the tenures of several important conductors who included William Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, and John Barbirolli. Judson also began managing individual artists, including pianists Alfred Cortot and Vladimir Horowitz, violinist Jasha Heifetz, and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. He also organized the U.S. tours of several prominent composers, including Igor Stravinsky and Vincent d''Indy. At the same time, Judson began managing conductors. His first clients were Stokowski and Fritz Reiner. By the 1930s, Judson''s conductor list included most of the important conductors working in America. Drawing on rich correspondence between Judson and the conductors and artists he served, James M. Doering demonstrates Judson''s multifaceted roles, including involvement with programming choices, building audiences, negotiating with orchestra members and their unions, and exploring new technologies for extending the orchestras'' reach. In addition to his colorful career behind the scenes at two preeminent American orchestras, Judson was important for a number of innovations in arts management. In 1922, he founded a nationwide network of local managers and later became involved in the relatively unexplored medium of radio, working first with WEAF in New York City and then later forming his own national radio network in 1927. Providing valuable insight into the workings of these orchestras and the formative years of arts management, The Great Orchestrator is a valuable portrait of one of the most powerful managers in American musical history.', DEFAULT, '16.5', '296', '2013-02-15', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EYv6DXDRuR0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Great Orchestrator')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The book is an outgrowth of an international symposium held in October 1999 that brought together scientists and researchers at the forefront of efforts to process information about species at different spatial and temporal scales. It is a comprehensive reference that offers an exhaustive treatment of the subject, with 65 chapters by leading experts from around the world that: review the history of the theory and practice of modeling and present a standard terminology examine temporal and spatial scales in terms of their influence on patterns and processes of species distribution offer detailed discussions of state-of-the-art modeling tools and descriptions of methods for assessing model accuracy discuss how to predict species presence and abundance present examples of how spatially explicit data on demographics can provide important information for managers An introductory chapter by Michael A. Huston examines the ecological context in which predictions of species occurrences are made, and a concluding chapter by John A. Wiens offers an insightful review and synthesis of the topics examined along with guidance for future directions and cautions regarding misuse of models. Other contributors include Michael P.

Readers will learn to: differentiate and gain an in-depth understanding of perspectives from varying narrators; recognize how stories are constructed and used in organizations, and modify the stories they tell; view stories as a means to promote an open exchange of creativity. By integrating a range of theories and practices, Browning and Morris write for an audience of narrative novices and scholars alike.

It occurs when solutions to address clients’ needs are developed in collaboration and the resulting products and services are distributed through a flexible network of partners. Daniel Fasnacht’s book, the first of its kind, discusses open business models in the context of the financial services industry. He elaborates the drivers for strategic change such as increasingly sophisticated clients or demanding shareholders among other trends, including the recent global financial crisis, and explains why the transition from a closed model of operation to open innovation is vital. Various case studies illustrate how to integrate the client into the firm''s innovation process and emphasize the importance of smart client segmentation and a holistic advisory model to serve clients around the globe. Leaders must develop a set of new management practices to be able to invest in multiple strategic directions. They are responsible for giving clients a remarkable experience and for creating social relationship capital based upon an open innovation culture. Open Innovation in the Financial Services provides a much-needed framework for helping to understand industry dynamics in banking and to make the most of organizational energy by using open innovation to sustain profitable growth.

Mechanisms have been devised to hide the heterogeneity of the host operating systems and abstract the issues of distribution and object location. However, in order for systems to inter-operate securely there must also be mechanisms to hide differences in security policy, or at least negotiate between them. This would suggest that a uniform model of access control is required. Such a model must be extremely flexible with respect to the specification of policy, as different applications have radically different needs. In a widely distributed environment this situation is exacerbated by the differing requirements of different organisations, and in an open environment there is a need to interwork with organisations using alternative security mechanisms. Other proposals for the interworking of security mechanisms have concentrated on the enforcement of access policy, and neglected the concerns of freedom of expression of this policy. For example it is common to associate each request with a user identity, and to use this as the only parameter when performing access control. This work descibes an architectural approach to security. By reconsidering the role of the client and the server, we may reformulate access control issues in terms of client naming. We think of a client as obtaining a name issued by a service; either based on credentials already held by the client, or by delegation from another client. A grammar has been devised that allows the conditions under which a client may assume a name to be specified, and the conditions under which use of the name will be revoked. This allows complex security policies to be specified that define how clients of a service may interact with each other (through election, delegation and revocation), how clients interact with a service (by invoking operations or receiving events) and how clients and services may inter-operate. (For example, a client of a Login service may become a client of a file service.) This approach allows great flexibility when integrating a number of services, and reduces the mismatch of policies common in heterogeneous systems. A flexible security definition is meaningless if not backed by a robust and efficient implementation. In this thesis we present a systems architecture that can be implemented efficiently, but that allows individual services to ''fine tune'' the trade-offs between security, efficiency and freedom of policy expression. The architecture is inherently distributed and scalable, and includes mechanisms for rapid and selective revocation of privileges which may cascade between services and organisations."', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '102', '1996', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ti8kAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'OASIS: an Open Architecture for Secure Interworking Services')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Rendell completed Dark Corners shortly before her death in 2015. When his father dies, Carl Martin inherits a house in an increasingly rich and trendy London neighborhood. Cash poor, Carl rents the upstairs room and kitchen to the first person he interviews, Dermot McKinnon. That is mistake number one. Mistake number two is keeping the bizarre collection of homeopathic and alternative “cures” that his father left in the medicine cabinet, including a stash of controversial diet pills.

Only this time he flees the scene, leaving behind a freezer truck loaded with Bogart ice cream and a dead body—frozen solid and covered in chocolate and chopped pecans. As fate would have it, Stephanie’s mentor and occasional employer, Ranger, needs her to go undercover at the Bogart factory to find out who’s putting their employees on ice and sabotaging the business. It’s going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It’s also going to be hard to explain to Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger, late nights with Lula and Randy Briggs—who are naked and afraid—and late nights keeping tabs on Grandma Mazur and her new fella.

Things just aren’t adding up, and Stephanie can’t shake the feeling that something funny is going on at the college—and it’s not just Zeta fraternity pranks.

She''s a product of the "burg," a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Now Stephanie''s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad''s, doing her best to sever the world''s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler, and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, fearless bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli is also the irresistible macho pig who took Stephanie''s virginity at age sixteen and then wrote the details on the bathroom wall of Mario''s Sub Shop. There''s still powerful chemistry between these two, so the chase should be interesting.

Researchers from diverse fields of science have taken an interest in these bacterial toxins; they are studied, for example, by microbiologists, biochemists, cell biologists, and pharmacologists. There are two principal reasons for the broad and still growing interest in ADP ribosylating toxins. First, insights into the structure and functions of the toxins might be the key to prevention and treatment of diseases caused by the toxin-producing infectious micro organisms. Second, the ADP-ribosylating toxins provide potent and often unique pharmacological tools for the study of the physiological functions of their target proteins. The latter is especially the case with cholera and pertussis toxins, which both modify the IX-subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins involved in signal transduction pathways. These toxins have proved invaluable in extending our basic understanding of the regulation of hormone-controlled signal transduction. This volume provides a review and an update of recent studies on the basic properties of bacterial ADP-ribosylating tbxins and/or exoenzymes. Our current knowledge of the cel lular entry mechanisms of ADP-ribosylating toxins is reviewed by MADSHUS and STENMARK. WILSON and COLLIER then deal with recent insights into the enzyme mechanism and active site structure of diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, which modify elongation factor 2.

Drawing on a variety of application areas, from pharmaceuticals to machinery, the book presents numerous examples of experiments and exercises that enable students to perform their own experiments. Harnessing the capabilities of SAS 9.2, it includes examples of SAS data step programming and IML, along with procedures from SAS Stat, SAS QC, and SAS OR. The text also shows how to display experimental results graphically using SAS ODS graphics. The author emphasizes how the sample size, the assignment of experimental units to combinations of treatment factor levels (error control), and the selection of treatment factor combinations (treatment design) affect the resulting variance and bias of estimates as well as the validity of conclusions. This textbook covers both classical ideas in experimental design and the latest research topics.

Scouring the darkest corners of the Highlands and Western Isles, Robert the Bruce handpicks ten warriors to help him in his quest to free Scotland from English rule. They are the best of the best, chosen for their superior skills in each discipline of warfare. And to lead his secret Highland Guard, Bruce chooses the greatest warrior of all. The ultimate Highland warlord and a swordsman without equal, Tor MacLeod has no intention of being drawn into Scotland’s war against the English. Dedicated to his clan, the fiercely independent chief answers to no one—especially not to his alluring new bride, bartered to him in a bid to secure his command of the deadliest fighting force the world has ever seen. The treacherous chit who made her way to Tor’s bed may have won his hand, but she will never claim his heart. Although her husband’s reputation is as fierce as his manner, Christina Fraser believes that something softer hides beneath his brutal shell. But the only warmth she feels is in their bed, in glorious moments of white-hot desire that disappear with the dawn. When Christina’s reckless bid to win her husband’s love goes awry and thrusts them into danger on the eve of war, Tor will face his ultimate battle: to save his wife and to open his heart—before it’s too late.

For decades people have unquestioningly accepted the idea that our goal is to preserve nature in its pristine, pre-human state. But many scientists have come to see this as an outdated dream that thwarts bold new plans to save the environment and prevents us from having a fuller relationship with nature. Humans have changed the landscapes they inhabit since prehistory, and climate change means even the remotest places now bear the fingerprints of humanity. Emma Marris argues convincingly that it is time to look forward and create the "rambunctious garden," a hybrid of wild nature and human management. In this optimistic book, readers meet leading scientists and environmentalists and visit imaginary Edens, designer ecosystems, and Pleistocene parks. Marris describes innovative conservation approaches, including rewilding, assisted migration, and the embrace of so-called novel ecosystems.

Larry Weaner is an icon in the world of ecological landscape design, and now his revolutionary approach is available to all gardeners. Garden Revolution shows how an ecological approach to planting can lead to beautiful gardens that buck much of conventional gardening’s counter-productive, time-consuming practices. Instead of picking the wrong plant and then constantly tilling, weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing, Weaner advocates for choosing plants that are adapted to the soil and climate of a specific site and letting them naturally evolve over time. Allowing the plants to find their own niches, to spread their seed around until they find the microclimate and spot that suits them best, creates a landscape that is vibrant, dynamic, and gorgeous year after year.', DEFAULT, '3.03', '336', '2016-05-18', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8v8MDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Garden Revolution')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Foremost on that list is mobility, since going wireless frees you from the tether of an Ethernet cable at a desk. But that''s just the tip of the cable-free iceberg. Wireless networks are also more flexible, faster and easier for you to use, and more affordable to deploy and maintain. The de facto standard for wireless networking is the 802.11 protocol, which includes Wi-Fi (the wireless standard known as 802.11b) and its faster cousin, 802.11g. With easy-to-install 802.11 network hardware available everywhere you turn, the choice seems simple, and many people dive into wireless computing with less thought and planning than they''d give to a wired network. But it''s wise to be familiar with both the capabilities and risks associated with the 802.11 protocols. And 802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition is the perfect place to start. This updated edition covers everything you''ll ever need to know about wireless technology. Designed with the system administrator or serious home user in mind, it''s a no-nonsense guide for setting up 802.11 on Windows and Linux. Among the wide range of topics covered are discussions on: deployment considerations network monitoring and performance tuning wireless security issues how to use and select access points network monitoring essentials wireless card configuration security issues unique to wireless networks With wireless technology, the advantages to its users are indeed plentiful. Companies no longer have to deal with the hassle and expense of wiring buildings, and households with several computers can avoid fights over who''s online.

Yet Qatar has climbed to this pinnacle of wealth and influence in a remarkably short time, and from a starting point of obscurity and insignificance. This astonishing transition is the direct result of the efforts nearly 200 years ago of one visionary man - Jassim bin Muhammad Bin Thani, known as ''the Leader''. Qatar in the 1830s was a fragmented region, a desert peninsula without security or borders, where coastal communities depended on pearling for survival, while constantly at the mercy of tribal raiders. Jassim''s background in this precarious environment led to his understanding that the gap between tribal settled peoples must be bridged, and then to his harnessing of regional conflicts to create a unified Qatari state. Skilfully allying with Ottoman forces to fend off the British, Jassim established power in the newly rebuilt capital, Doha, eventually becoming the first leader of the new country. Little known outside Qatar, Jassim''s extraordinary achievement cannot be understated. By the time of his death on the eve of the First World War, both the Ottomans and the British had recognised Qatar''s autonomy, and the way was open for the country he had created to move steadily forward to its enviable economic position today.', DEFAULT, '13.6', '219', '2012-12-06', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X_J9kiBRdIgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Jassim the Leader')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Since ‘black gold’ catapulted the oil-producing countries into the limelight of the international political and economic scene, there has been a proliferation of studies on the larger exporting states. However, many of the so-called ‘small countries’ have been neglected in this exercise. This book presents the first detailed examination of the bases and extent of economic development in Qatar and considers the need to translate the petroleum-generated growth into viable, self-sustained development. Qatar, though not one of the oil ‘giants’, was first in the field of oil development and exhibits a number of special features not shared by its Gulf neighbours: for example in pre-oil boom days it was already in advance of many other Gulf states in the field of education; it has a modest agriculture sector and there is a comparatively strong attachment to the land; and finally it has played an important role in OPEC as a member of the ‘moderate price’ camp. The individual chapters trace the development of the oil industry, outline public financing and economic policy and sketch the issues involved in industrialisation, absorptive capacity and agricultural development. Examination is made of the social and physical infrastructure as well as money and banking, and the international linkages in trade, foreign aid, economic cooperation efforts and investment opportunities are elucidated. Planners in Qatar know that their revenue base in petroleum is finite, and thus investment of present surplus needs careful planning. The book therefore also outlines current government priorities and suggests areas for future investments.

That is the message of ''Reboot '' While American culture glamorizes the "Golden Years" of endless leisure and amusement, Phil Burgess rejects retirement, as he makes the case for returning to work in the post-career years, a time he calls later life. Based on solid research from the social and medical sciences, the author says, "It is better to die with your boots on, fully engaged in helping others and repairing the world." ''Reboot '' is partly autobiographical. Indeed, the author is working well into his own post-career years, following two failed retirements. He is also convincing in his eye-opening, historically rooted, and hope-filled arguments for engaging in life-long work that is productive and satisfying. ''Reboot '' identifies five different types of work: ''in-kind, '' ''volunteer, '' ''Samaritan, '' ''enrichment, '' and ''paid work.'' ''Booters'' who incorporate one or more of these types of work into their post-career lifestyle will, according to Burgess, live longer, live better, and die faster - avoiding boredom, aimless busy-ness, diminished self-worth and the anguish (and cost) of lingering death. With America''s 78 million boomers turning 65 at the rate of 10,000 a day for the next 18 years, ''Reboot '' provides a timely and provocative alternative to the conventional idea of retirement. With the promises of Social Security and Medicare about to be broken, ''Reboot '' provides an upbeat and constructive way to deal with new financial realities. For men and women navigating life''s transitions, striving to finish well, ''Reboot '' provides a roadmap for living a life of meaning, challenging the reader to be a booter, not a retiree. Burgess boldly asserts that retirement is a deadly disease, and that work after a life of work is the best option for post-career years that are meaningful, productive, healthy, and satisfying.

In his Peruvian superfoods diet, Villacorta provides simple yet thorough explanations of weight-loss, anti-aging, and disease-fighting concepts by using an appealing page layout displaying beautiful color photography, easy-to-read bullet points, and sidebars summarizing each health benefit.

It emphasizes the basic principles, and aims to progress rapidly to the point of being able to handle physically and mathematically interesting problems, without getting bogged down in excessive formalism. Lagrangian methods are introduced at a relatively early stage, to get students to appreciate their use in simple contexts. Later chapters use Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods extensively, but in a way that aims to be accessible to undergraduates, while including modern developments at the appropriate level of detail. The subject has been developed considerably recently while retaining a truly central role for all students of physics and applied mathematics.This edition retains all the main features of the fourth edition, including the two chapters on geometry of dynamical systems and on order and chaos, and the new appendices on conics and on dynamical systems near a critical point. The material has been somewhat expanded, in particular to contrast continuous and discrete behaviours. A further appendix has been added on routes to chaos (period-doubling) and related discrete maps.

Even then, however, martial use was only one aspect of Iron Shirt Chi Kung, and today its other aspects remain vitally significant for anyone seeking better health, a sound mind, and spiritual growth. In Iron Shirt Chi Kung Master Mantak Chia introduces this ancient practice that strengthens the internal organs, establishes roots to the earth’s energy, and unifies physical, mental, and spiritual health. Through a unique system of breathing exercises, he demonstrates how to permanently pack concentrated air into the connective tissues (the fasciae) surrounding vital organs, making them nearly impervious to injuries--a great benefit to athletes and other performers. He shows readers how once they root themselves in the earth they can direct its gravitational and healing power throughout their bone structure. Additionally, Master Chia presents postural forms, muscle-tendon meridians, and guidelines for developing a daily practice routine.

This highly readable volume details everything from the glacial formation of the land to the arrival of the Dakota and the Ojibwe people, from Minnesota''s contributions to the Northern cause during the Civil War to the key players in reform politics who helped sculpt the identity of the state today. A Popular History of Minnesota highlights the historical significance of Minnesota''s natural resources--the bountiful north woods, the treasured iron ranges, the impressive Mississippi waterfall on which the Mill City was built. It details the powerful marks left on the state by such luminous figures as Oliver H. Kelley, founder of the national Grange movement, Hubert H. Humphrey, champion of civil rights, and Betty Crocker, aid to homemakers everywhere. Lively sidebars outline noteworthy subjects, from the Kensington runestone to the devastating forest fires of the 1890s and 1910s, from the rise of the Mayo Clinic to the preservation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

Renowned Minnesota architecture critic and historian Larry Millett conducts us on an eye-opening, spectacularly illustrated tour of this rich and varied landscape, with its graphic insights into the building of midcentury Middle America. A history lesson as entertaining as it is enlightening, Minnesota Modern provides a close-up view of a style that penetrated the social, political, and cultural machinery of the times. Extending from modest suburban ramblers and ranch houses to the grandest public and commercial structures, midcentury modernism expressed a whole way of thinking about how to live, work, and play in communities that sprang up as thousands of military members returned from World War II. Millett describes the style''s sources--in the work of European masters like Ludvig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, as well as the midwestern innovations of Frank Lloyd Wright--and its refinement at the University of Minnesota under the guidance of Ralph Rapson and other modernists. He shows us its applications in twelve midcentury homes in Minnesota and takes us through its many permutations in sites as different as Barry Byrne''s intimate St. Columba Catholic Church in St. Paul and Eero Saarinen''s sprawling IBM complex in Rochester.

In All Joy and No Fun, award-winning journalist Jennifer Senior tries to tackle this question, isolating and analyzing the many ways in which children reshape their parents'' lives, whether it''s their marriages, their jobs, their habits, their hobbies, their friendships, or their internal senses of self. She argues that changes in the last half century have radically altered the roles of today''s mothers and fathers, making their mandates at once more complex and far less clear. Recruiting from a wide variety of sources—in history, sociology, economics, psychology, philosophy, and anthropology—she dissects both the timeless strains of parenting and the ones that are brand new, and then brings her research to life in the homes of ordinary parents around the country. The result is an unforgettable series of family portraits, starting with parents of young children and progressing to parents of teens. Through lively and accessible storytelling, Senior follows these mothers and fathers as they wrestle with some of parenthood''s deepest vexations—and luxuriate in some of its finest rewards. Meticulously researched yet imbued with emotional intelligence, All Joy and No Fun makes us reconsider some of our culture''s most basic beliefs about parenthood, all while illuminating the profound ways children deepen and add purpose to our lives.

In Thoreau’s Democratic Withdrawal, Shannon L. Mariotti explores Thoreau’s nature writings to offer a new way of understanding the unique politics of the so-called hermit of Walden Pond. Drawing imaginatively from the twentieth-century German social theorist Theodor W. Adorno, she shows how withdrawal from the public sphere can paradoxically be a valuable part of democratic politics. Separated by time, space, and context, Thoreau and Adorno share a common belief that critical inquiry is essential to democracy but threatened by modern society. While walking, huckleberrying, and picking wild apples, Thoreau tries to recover the capacities for independent perception and thought that are blunted by “Main Street,” conventional society, and the rapidly industrializing world that surrounded him. Adorno’s thoughts on particularity and the microscopic gaze he employs to work against the alienated experience of modernity help us better understand the value of Thoreau’s excursions into nature. Reading Thoreau with Adorno, we see how periodic withdrawals from public spaces are not necessarily apolitical or apathetic but can revitalize our capacity for the critical thought that truly defines democracy. In graceful, readable prose, Mariotti reintroduces us to a celebrated American thinker, offers new insights on Adorno, and highlights the striking common ground they share. Their provocative and challenging ideas, she shows, still hold lessons on how we can be responsible citizens in a society that often discourages original, critical analysis of public issues.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '222', '2010-01-21', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=NdLfcuEeA6MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Thoreau’s Democratic Withdrawal')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The awkward reality is that an Iraqi-U.S. failure to properly manage the U.S. withdrawal and the creation of effective Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) is as serious a threat to Iraq''s future stability and security as any internal or external threat. Realism is a key to future success. The improvement in ISF capabilities is very real, and Iraqi forces are experiencing growing success in combat. But they are still very much a work in progress, and many Iraqi and U.S. politicians still seem unaware of how much remains to be done. U.S. forces play a critical role in developing the effectiveness of the ISF, providing stability in areas with deep sectarian and ethnic tensions and helping Iraq achieve political accommodation and more effective governance.Through detailed analyses of Iraqi force capabilities, augmented by on-site interviews with U.S. and Iraqi military officials, the authors conclude that the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq needs to be “conditions-based,” not tied to political timelines. Both Iraqi and U.S. leaders need to be careful about exaggerating Iraqi capabilities and the speed with which the United States can safely withdraw its forces and advisory teams. Conditions for success include realistic and fully resourced plans for the ISF''s development; candid and accurate measures of ISF capabilities; and careful assessments of the overall level of security, stability, and political accommodation in Iraq.After years of destructive conflict, Iraq now has the chance, however tenuous, to become a stable and prosperous country.

But Diego Cordovez and Selig S. Harrison shatter this image. Out of Afghanistan shows that the Red Army was securely entrenched when the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw: American weaponry and Afghan bravery raised the costs for Moscow, but it was six years of skillful diplomacy that gave the Russians a way out. Cordovez and Harrison provide the definitive account of the Soviet blunders that led up to the invasion and the bitter struggles over the withdrawal that raged in the Soviet and Afghan Communist parties and the Reagan Administration. The authors are particularly well-suited to their task: Cordovez was the United Nations mediator who negotiated the Soviet pullout, and Harrison is a leading South Asia expert with four decades of experience in covering Afghanistan. Their story of the U.N. negotiations is interwoven with a gripping chronicle of the war years, complete with palace shootouts in Kabul, turf warfare between rival Soviet intelligence agencies, and the CIA role in building up Islamic fundamentalist guerrilla leaders at the expense of Afghan moderates. Cordovez opens up his diaries to take us behind the scenes in his negotiations, and Harrison draws on interviews with Mikhail Gorbachev, former Secretary of State George Shultz, and other key actors. The result is a book full of surprises. For example, the authors demonstrate that the Soviets intervened not out of a desire to drive to the Indian Ocean, but out of a fear of a U.S.-supported Afghan Tito. Rebuffs by hardline "bleeders" in the Reagan Administration undermined efforts by Yuri Andropov to secure a settlement before his death in 1983. Even more startling, Gorbachev resumed the search for a negotiated withdrawal more than a year before the first American-supplied Stinger missiles were deployed in the war. The Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was one of the pivotal events of recent history.

A violinist by training, Judson became manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1915 under the iconic conductor Leopold Stokowski. Within a few years, Judson also took on management of the New York Philharmonic, navigating a period of change and the tenures of several important conductors who included William Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, and John Barbirolli. Judson also began managing individual artists, including pianists Alfred Cortot and Vladimir Horowitz, violinist Jasha Heifetz, and cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. He also organized the U.S. tours of several prominent composers, including Igor Stravinsky and Vincent d''Indy. At the same time, Judson began managing conductors. His first clients were Stokowski and Fritz Reiner. By the 1930s, Judson''s conductor list included most of the important conductors working in America. Drawing on rich correspondence between Judson and the conductors and artists he served, James M. Doering demonstrates Judson''s multifaceted roles, including involvement with programming choices, building audiences, negotiating with orchestra members and their unions, and exploring new technologies for extending the orchestras'' reach. In addition to his colorful career behind the scenes at two preeminent American orchestras, Judson was important for a number of innovations in arts management. In 1922, he founded a nationwide network of local managers and later became involved in the relatively unexplored medium of radio, working first with WEAF in New York City and then later forming his own national radio network in 1927. Providing valuable insight into the workings of these orchestras and the formative years of arts management, The Great Orchestrator is a valuable portrait of one of the most powerful managers in American musical history.', DEFAULT, '16.5', '296', '2013-02-15', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EYv6DXDRuR0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Great Orchestrator')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Over time, credit ratings have gradually taken on an expanding role, both in the United States and abroad and in official financial market regulation as well as in private capital market decisions. However, in 1999 the Bank for International Settlements (through its Committee on Banking Supervision) proposed rule changes that would provide an explicit role for credit ratings in determining a bank''s required regulatory risk capital. Once implemented, this BIS proposal (often referred to as Basel 2) would vastly elevate the importance of credit ratings by linking the required measure of bank capital to the credit rating of the bank''s obligors. With these regulatory changes under active discussion, research into the role for ratings and rating agencies in the global financial system is particularly apropos. Ratings, Rating Agencies and the Global Financial System brings together the research of economists at New York University and the University of Maryland, along with those from the private sector, government bodies, and other universities. The first section of the volume focuses on the historical origins of the credit rating business and its present day industrial organization structure. The second section presents several empirical studies crafted largely around individual firm-level or bank-level data. These studies examine (a) the relationship between ratings and the default and recovery experience of corporate borrowers, (b) the comparability of credit ratings made by domestic and foreign rating agencies, and (c) the usefulness of financial market indicators for rating banks, among other topics. In the third section, the record of sovereign credit ratings in predicting financial crises and the reaction of financial markets to changes in credit ratings is examined.

Sensor arrays helped usher in the age of wireless communication by meeting the increasing capacity requirements of ever growing wireless networks, but that is only one example of the number of uses served by this valuable technology across any number of fields. Extensively updated and expanded, Sensor Array Signal Processing, Second Edition covers a wide range of interrelated topics in array processing to provide an introduction to the field that one will not find in the literature. The book introduces new developments in the use of sensors in wireless networks and the use of distributed sensors for localization. It unravels layers of complexity to explore underlying basic principles of array signal processing, focusing on the common threads that exist in wavefield analysis, rather than on particular applications. Following an introduction to the basic equations governing different wavefields, the text provides updated coverage on current topics of interest. It analyzes various types of sensor configurations; focusing on those most useful for understanding array systems in practice — uniform linear and circular arrays. Fully updated with over 150 new pages, this new edition: Includes new chapters — emphasizing the use of sensor arrays in wireless communication and localization Adds new exercises and examples to the end of each chapter Provides information on emerging topics covering, distributed sensor array, multi-component sensors, space-time processing, azimuth/elevation estimation, wideband adaptive beamformation, and frequency invariant beamformation An invaluable tool for self-study, this book provides those working in or interested in medical imaging, astronomy, radar, communications, sonar, seismology or any field that studies propagating wavefields, with a highly accessible guide. It describes each concept in precise mathematical language complete with numerical examples, detailed illustrations, and practice exercises at the end of each chapter to reinforce concepts.

Several books have been written about ESAs, but most cover only fundamental theory. Few, if any, provide the insightful, easy-to-use simulation tools found in this book. Obviously, MATLAB® is one of the greatest tools available for exploring and understanding science and engineering concepts, and we use MATLAB functions to easily and instantly calculate ESA patterns. However, to achieve a truly insightful and in-depth analysis of subarray architectures, conformal arrays, etc., it is imperative that users first develop a firm grasp of ESA fundamentals. Covers largely unexplored topics, such as reliability aspects and the application of ESAs in space This volume helps readers build that elemental understanding of how ESAs work. It also provides code to run as an aid, so that readers don’t have to start from scratch. The book expands on ESA principles and provides a modeling framework, using MATLAB to model applications of ESAs (i.e. pattern optimization, space-based applications, and reliability analysis). Presented code serves as an excellent vehicle to help readers master the analysis and simulation of ESAs. Exploring how difficult problems can be simplified with short, elegant solutions, this is an invaluable resource for students and others new to ESAs, as well as experienced practicing engineers who model ESAs at the systems level.', DEFAULT, '158.36', '224', '2016-04-19', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nO_RBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Electronically Scanned Arrays MATLAB® Modeling and Simulation')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The Magnetic Field of the Earth draws together these major lines of inquiry into an integrated framework to highlight the interrelationships and thus to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the geomagnetic field. The text is organized so that paleomagnetists and dynamo theoreticians may both benefit from the results and arguments presented by the other.

Conversely, dynamo theory is explained in such a way that paleomagnetists may utilize it to present their data more effectively. Other important features of the book include a discussion of planetary magnetic fields and their implications for dynamo theory and the most recent set of magnetic charts.

Clearly, though, the promise of political reform did not fulfill the expectations of the public, and with about 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line, many Zambians are no longer confident that more open political systems can improve their lives. But the problem may not be inherent in the political process itself, and could be found more in the apparent disconnection between people''s needs and the way the country''s affairs are run. It is with respect to these and related issues that this book emphasizes the crucial relationship between education and political participation, and specifically highlights citizenship education as essential for Zambia''s social development. Social development, which should comprise, inter alia, the economic, political, and cultural wellbeing of societies can be enhanced by citizenship education, which focuses on elevating people''s understanding of their rights and responsibilities vis-a -vis government institutions, structures and functions. Indeed, it is the centrality of the political component in people''s lives, especially its relationship with public policy and public programs that should underline the important role of citizenship education. In describing these issues, the book analyzes the role of the media, women''s groups and youth in enhancing the political, educational, and by extension, the economic lives of the Zambian people.

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance--banking, saving, budgeting, and investing--and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship. Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn''t Have to Suck!"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don''t understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security. Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi''s website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully ("Your site summarizes everything I want with my life--to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings," Dan Esparza) and effusively ("Dude, you rock. I love this site!" Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: "Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in" (San Francisco Chronicle).

One policy that meets these criteria and warrants consideration is a farm savings account (FSA). It is crucial that the role of a FSA in a farm household''s portfolio is understood before implementing it as policy. Consequently, this research uses a discrete stochastic programming model to investigate the relationship between the FSA and the portfolio allocation choices (consumption, land allocation, stock, and debt) for a utility-maximizing farmer in a theoretical and empirical framework. This analysis shows that a FSA can help stabilize, enhance, and/or reduce the variability in wealth. The results also suggest that the availability of a FSA as an investment has significant impact on the asset allocation patterns for the household. First, the presence of matching government contributions motivates the household in ever year when they have sufficient cash to contribute funds to the FSA to receive these government contributions. This result occurs irrespective of the initial endowments, risk aversion level, and presence of other U.S. farm policies. Access to the FSA causes the household to decrease purchases of stocks compared to a household without access to the FSA. Second, the powerful income protection effects of the FSA help explain the observed willingness of the household to make annual land purchase decisions that are far larger than in the scenario without the FSA. In turn, this causes the household to have a much larger percentage of its assets financed with debt capital. The availability of a FSA results in modest increases in average terminal wealth, lower variability in terminal wealth, and no significant change in average annual consumption, but lower variability in consumption. Finally, as the amount of farmland in the portfolio grows, a decrease in the probability of a withdrawal and an increase in the size of the average withdrawal from the FSA can be observed. These results are consistent with prior research on the National Income Stabilization Account (NISA), a Canadian farm policy similar to the FSA.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '287', '2007', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4q7rZArbASYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Effect of Farm Savings Accounts on Farm Households'' Portfolios')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Written specifically for graphic designers and production artists already comfortable working with Adobe InDesign, this book teaches you how to automate publishing without learning a lot of scary code. XML simplifies the process of moving content in and out of your layouts and can speed up any print or Web assignment. Why should I care about XML? If you’re managing data-intensive layout projects, and you want to keep that data consistent, accurate, and up-to-date, then incorporating XML can help. You can also use XML to automate processes like importing text and large numbers of graphics into a layout, or repurposing content from one application to another. Do I need additional plug-ins or special software? You need only the powerful features built into InDesign CS2, CS3 or CS4 to use this book. How will I learn XML? This guide includes nine easy-to-follow projects with downloadable support files. With these hands-on tutorials, you will learn XML in context. By the final project, XML will no longer be a mystery, but a powerful tool you can use to support your company or clients. These real-world projects will teach you: l Business cards: Create a structured layout in InDesign and then import XML. Format text automatically and flow the text into multiple examples. l Product catalog: Learn how to import XML data into a structured layout using nested styles and cloned text. l Direct mail and variable data printing: Use XML and InDesign to create sophisticated direct mail pieces without costly plug-ins or third-party software. l Magazine and newspaper: Build and export magazine-style publications for online distribution. l Web: Transform XML into XHTML to incorporate directly into your Web pages, or use Cascading Style Sheets to instantly format your exported XML.', DEFAULT, '31.72', '336', '2007-12-04', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xe006J3HKKsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A Designer''s Guide to Adobe InDesign and XML')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This book takes a unique, wholly integrated look at the e-payment landscape, understanding the way that existing systems are being stretched and challenged. Credit card systems are extended to facilitate Internet-based eCommerce. Consumers are becoming accustomed to using their stored-value mass transit cards to make payments for goods and services. Corporations put pressure on banks to integrate business information into their electronic payment processes. New non-financial players emerge holding important floats and many of these players are challenging for key parts of the banking franchise.

The travelogue dominated the early cinema period from 1895 to 1905, was central to the consolidation of documentary in the 1910s and 1920s, proliferated in the postwar era of 16mm distribution, and today continues to flourish in IMAX theaters and a host of non-theatrical venues. It is not only the first chapter in the history of documentary but also a key element of ethnographic film, home movies, and fiction films. In this collection, leading film scholars trace the intersection of technology and ideology in representations of travel across a wide variety of cinematic forms. In so doing, they demonstrate how attention to the role of travel imagery in film blurs distinctions between genres and heightens awareness of cinema as a technology for moving through space and time, of cinema itself as a mode of travel. Some contributors take a broad view of travelogues by examining the colonial and imperial perspectives embodied in early travel films, the sensation of movement that those films evoked, and the role of live presentations such as lectures in our understanding of travelogues. Other essays are focused on specific films, figures, and technologies, including early travelogues encouraging Americans to move to the West; the making and reception of the documentary Grass (1925), shot on location in Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran; the role of travel imagery in 1930s Hollywood cinema; the late-twentieth-century 16mm illustrated-lecture industry; and the panoramic possibilities presented by IMAX technologies. Together the essays provide a nuanced appreciation of how, through their representations of travel, filmmakers actively produce the worlds they depict. Contributors.

Today we can draw on worldwide computer links, speeding up communications by radio, newspapers, and television. Ideas fly back and forth and circle the globe at the speed of electricity. And just around the corner lurks full-blown virtual reality, in which we will be able to immerse ourselves in a computer simulation not only of the actual physical world, but of any imagined world. As we begin to move in and out of a computer-generated world, Michael Heim asks, how will the way we perceive our world change? In The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, Heim considers this and other philosophical issues of the Information Age. With an eye for the dark as well as the bright side of computer technology, he explores the logical and historical origins of our computer-generated world and speculates about the future direction of our computerized lives. He discusses such topics as the effect of word-processing on the English language (while word-processors have led to increased productivity, they have also led to physical hazards such as repetitive motion syndrome, which causes inflamed hand and arm tendons). Heim looks into the new kind of literacy promised by Hypertext (technology which allows the user to link audio and video elements, the disadvantages including disorientation and cognitive overload). And he also probes the notion of virtual reality, "cyberspace"--the computer-simulated environments that have captured the popular imagination and may ultimately change the way we define reality itself. Just as the definition of interface itself has evolved from the actual adapter plug used to connect electronic circuits into human entry into a self-contained cyberspace, so too will the notion of reality change with the current technological drive. Like the introduction of the automobile, the advent of virtual reality will change the whole context in which our knowledge and awareness of life are rooted. And along the way, Heim covers such intriguing topics as how computers have altered our thought habits, how we will be able to distinguish virtual from real reality, and the appearance of virtual reality in popular culture (as in Star Trek''s holodeck, William Gibson''s Neuromancer, and Stephen King''s Lawnmower Man). Vividly and entertainingly written, The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality opens a window on a fascinating world that promises--or threatens--to become an integral part of everyday life in the 21st century.

This book uncovers the sophisticated techniques of the "virtual” political system used to legitimize post-Soviet regimes: entire fake parties, phantom political rivals and "scarecrow” opponents. And it exposes the paramount role of the mass media in projecting these creations and in falsifying the entire political process. Wilson argues that it is not primarily economic problems that have made it so difficult to develop meaningful democracy in the former Soviet world. Although the West also has its "spin doctors,” dirty tricks, and aggressive ad campaigns, it is the unique post-Bolshevik culture of "political technology” that is the main obstacle to better governance in the region, to real popular participation in public affairs, and to the modernization of the political economy in the longer term.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '332', '2005', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=h3By77UU4nIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Virtual Politics')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

You''ll learn the three key parts of a successful backup strategy, advice for backing up digital photos and massive video projects, and time-tested recommendations for setting up, testing, maintaining, and restoring backups. Whether you''re running Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, 10.6 Snow Leopard, or 10.5 Leopard, you''ll soon have a reliable, up-to-date backup system. Includes coupons worth $30 off Data Backup and 10% off CrashPlan! Although the 210-page ebook is organized so you can start backing up without reading every page, the full ebook will teach you to: Design a reliable backup system. If you''re developing a new backup system, you''ll learn how to make it not only thorough, ensuring that all your data is safe, but also easy to manage. And if you''re reassessing and redesigning an existing backup system, Joe provides detailed advice about how to evaluate it and offers guidance for improving and modernizing it. Talk like an expert. You''ll understand terms like "versioned backups," "push" and "pull" backups, "duplicates," "server," "client," "incremental," "hard link," "metadata," "mirroring," and "snapshot." Shop for hardware. You''ll discover the pros and cons of different backup media options such as hard drives (with USB, FireWire, eSATA, or Thunderbolt interfaces - and with or without full-disk encryption), flash drives, optical media, tape drives, RAIDs, Drobo storage devices, Time Capsules, and NAS and SAN devices. Choose backup software. You''ll learn about 14 key features and find overviews and tips for 8 noteworthy backup products (an online appendix covers nearly 100 options), plus several suggestions for online backups. You''ll also get Joe''s personal recommendations to help you sort through the possibilities. Operate your Time Machine. You''ll find what goes on beneath Time Machine''s simple surface, and how best to make use of Apple''s built-in backup system, including how Lion''s local backups work when your Time Machine volume isn''t available, and how to encrypt a Time Machine backup. Make backups. No matter what backup software you decide to use, Joe provides a conceptual walk-through of the entire process, offering basic information for people who''ve never made a backup before and savvy, real-world suggestions for making the backup process as easy as possible. Deal with special backup needs. You''ll learn what to do about certain kinds of data that may require special backup strategies, such as large media archives, frequently changing files that need special versioned backup treatment, and Windows files and volumes hosted on your Mac. Recover lost data. Use your backup to recover lost data successfully in the event of a hard disk crash or other calamity.

Distributed databases and the infrastructure needed to support them have been well studied. However, this book is the first to address distributed database interoperability by examining the successes and failures, various approaches, infrastructures, and trends of the field. A gap exists in the way that these systems have been investigated by real practitioners. This gap is more pronounced than usual, partly because of the way businesses operate, the systems they have, and the difficulties created by systems'' autonomy and heterogeneity. Telecommunications firms, for example, must deal with an increased demand for automation while at the same time continuing to function at their current level. While academics are focusing on investigating differences between distributed databases, federated databases, heterogeneous databases, and, more generally, among loosely connected and tightly coupled systems, those who have to deal with real problems right away know that the only relevant research is the one that will ensure that their system works to produce reasonably correct results. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems covers the underlying principles and infrastructures needed to realize truly global information systems. The book discusses technologies related to middleware, the Web, workflows, transactions, and data warehousing. It also overviews architectures with a discussion of critical issues. The book gives an overview of systems that can be viewed as learning platforms. While these systems do not translate to successful commercial realities, they push the envelope in terms of research. Successful commercial systems have benefited from the experiments conducted in these prototypes. The book includes two case studies based on the authors'' own work.

Later chapters explore multiagent scenarios, navigation and path-planning for mobile robots, and the basics of computer vision and range sensing. Each chapter includes objectives, review questions, and exercises. Many chapters contain one or more case studies showing how the concepts were implemented on real robots.

Discovering musical mind draws together in one source these classic studies, offering the chance to revisit and reconsider some of her conclusions. Reviewing the data in light of current theories of cognitive development, she discusses how some of the conclusions she drew stand up to scrutiny, whilst in other cases, anomalies turn out to have greater significance than expected. The book is a collection of Bamberger''s papers from 1975 to 2011. It includes her first study of Beethoven''s original fingerings, her beginning work with children''s invented notations, close observations and analysis of children in the Laboratory for Making Things, studies of musically gifted children, and the emergent musical development of students in elementary-secondary school and university undergraduate and graduate studies. The observations and research lead to the development of an interactive, computer-based music environment that uses her pragmatic theory of musical development as the basis for a project-oriented program for teaching and learning. Unlike other collections, the book is both interdisciplinary and strongly practical. It brings together and integrates Bamberger''s background in music theory, research in music perception and music education, performance, cognitive development, artificial intelligence, and procedural music composition. Her multi-faceted approach to music theory and music pedagogy is guided throughout by her commitment to an understanding and respect for an individual''s natural, creative musical intelligence. This natural competence becomes the formative ground on which to help people of all ages build an ever growing understanding and engagement with the evolving structures of the world''s music.

While most of these organizations have no direct connection to human rights issues, their participation in broader IGO networks has important implications for the human rights practices of their member states. Featuring a rigorous empirical analysis, Transmitting Rights shows that countries tend to adopt similar human rights practices to those of their IGO partners, whether for better or worse. Greenhill argues that IGOs constitute a tightly-woven fabric of ties between states and that this network provides an important channel through which states can influence the behavior of others. Indeed, his analysis suggests that a policy of isolating "rogue" states is probably self-defeating given that this will reduce their exposure to some of the more positive IGO-based influences on their human rights.

Although there are no known examples of arch dams which have been seriously damaged by earthquakes, the need for more realistic seismic analyses is now well recognized, not only for new dams but especially in the context of the safety evaluation of existing dams. Fortunately, with the finite element method, engineers have a powerful tool for modeling the complex geometry and the nonlinear material behavior of a dam. However, there is still a major complication in the analysis procedure, namely the interaction of the dam with the reservoir and with the foundation during an earthquake. Interaction is a wave propagation problem involving transmitting boundaries. The State of the Art in engineering practice is to neglect wave propagation by modeling the water as incompressible and the foundation as massless. More advanced analysis methods using compressible water and foundation with mass have been available for some time. However, these methods are restricted to linear models, because they work in the frequency domain. On the other hand, there are also advanced nonlinear models for dams, but they can only be used in the time domain, usually with simple transmitting boundaries. In this report, which is based on an a doctoral thesis, rigorous transmitting boundaries in the time domain are developed which permit combining compressible water with n- linear dam behavior.

The main island is actually two irregular ovals hinged together like an open oyster shell. Smaller outer islands float nearby like spilled pearls in the turquoise sea. Grande-Terre, the eastern half of the shell, is basically a flat field of lush sugarcane dotted with colorful towns and rimmed by long, sandy beaches. Basse-Terre is a mountainous forest marked by waterfalls, rivers, hot springs and a volcano. The two are joined by a bridge over the Rivière-Salée, a channel that connects the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre: Why, you may wonder, is the smaller, flatter half of the island called Grande-Terre (big land), and the larger, mountainous half called Basse-Terre (low land)? The only theory that makes sense is that early sailors, with their obligatory obsession for wind, noticed that northeastern trade winds blew grande when they hit the flat eastern shore, but basse when they pushed over the mountains in the west. The less developed islands of Marie-Galante, Les Saintes and La Désirade stretch out along the double island''s southern shore. Les Saintes is actually a collection of mini-islands that are rocky and steep like Basse-Terre. Marie-Galante is flatter and similar to Grande-Terre topographically. La Désirade is a long, narrow, rugged rock with one road, only a few residents and limited facilities a nature-lover''s dream. Most visitors choose to stay on the main island and take day-trips or overnight excurions to the outer islands. Grande-Terre and Basse-Terre are connected by a highway that bridges the channel between them, so driving from one to the other is simple. Boats leave for the outer islands from four towns on the main island''s southern coast, and they are the quickest and least expensive way to island-hop. Air Guadeloupe flies daily from the international airport near Pointe-à-Pitre to Les Saintes, Marie-Galante and La Désirade. Because the island is so diverse, in a single day you can enjoy a drive along both the jagged coast of the wild Atlantic and the pristine coves of the calm Caribbean or hike uphill into the rain forest then nap on a sunny beach. Several towns on both Basse-Terre and Grande-Terre offer gourmet dining, lively entertainment and world-class lodging. Because the archipelago is a legitimate région of France, you will enjoy French-style comfort and cuisine with a tropical twist wherever you stay. This tropical twist is one of Guadeloupe''s many charms. Shops and offices close between noon and 2 o''clock for a leisurely gourmet lunch with wine, as they typically do all over Europe. But, out on the streets, the music has a decidedly African beat. The women wear madras headdresses as they do in India, and the aroma of West Indies spices permeates the air. Another appealing quality is the stable economy that makes Guadeloupe neither rich nor poor. Towns aren''t filled with tourist-badgering hustlers or begging street people. At the same time, the islanders are friendly, and a simple bonjour breaks the language barrier. There aren''t a lot of fancy boutiques or glitzy nightspots, but everyone seems to have plenty of everything they need.

In the case of the French Caribbean, the work of several writers (Aime Cesaire, Frantz Fanon, Edouard Glissant and Patrick Chamoiseau, for example) has gained international recognition, and has formed a vital part of more general debates on history, culture, language and identity in the post colonial world. The majority of such writers, however, have been male and, perhaps recalling the preference that France has always shown for the island, have come in large part from Martinique. Mapping a Tradition: Francophone Women''s Writing from Guadeloupe aims to explore a different side of francophone Caribbean writing through the examination of selected novels by Jacqueline Manicom, Michele Lacrosil, Maryse Conde, Simone Schwarz-Bart and Dany Bebel-Gisler. Placing the work of these writers in the context of that of their better-known, male counterparts, this study argues that it has provided an important mode of intervention in, and disruption of, a literary tradition which has failed to address questions of sexual difference and has often excluded issues relating to French Caribbean women. At the same time, this study suggests that Guadeloupean women''s writing of the last thirty years may he seen to constitute a ''tradition'' in itself, replete with its own influences and inheritances. At once within, and outside the ''dominant'' tradition, women''s writing from Guadeloupe - and Martinique - has come to occupy a position at the forefront of contemporary efforts to expand and redefine a still-burgeoning corpus of literary and theoretical work.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '234', '2000', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=gamwDtyXY0AC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Mapping a Tradition')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It then takes the reader through Roman and Saxon times to the Middle Ages and on to the visible remains of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It vividly records the impact of the industrial revolution and the rapid developments of the nineteenth century, and the final chapters show the motorways, housing estates, city centres and golf courses of the twentieth century.

As he says, he''s been hired and fired, and had his share of disappointments and failures. He''s also had successes at every level. Now an ESPN broadcaster and one of the most respected NHL analysts on television. With his trademark hair, custom suits and energetic style, Melrose is applauded for offering fans his honest - tell it like it is opinion. Written in Barry''s voice and style, the narrative follows his career in hockey, from its start in Kelvington, Saskatchewan, through his years in Junior, the WHA, and finally, the NHL. Along the way, Barry muses on the state of the game, what makes some teams work and other fail, and how he worked to instill a winning attitude in all the teams he coached. Filled with behind-the-scene stories of all the legendary players Barry played with or coached - Gretzky, Yzerman, Messier, Bobby Hull, and Brad Park - Dropping the Gloves is a true to life, insiders account of the world of professional hockey and an absolute must read for fans of the game.', DEFAULT, '13.99', '256', '2012-10-16', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IL5BpcjOLIcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Dropping the Gloves')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Robert Anasi took up boxing in his twenties to keep in shape, attract women, and sharpen his knuckles for the odd bar fight. He thought of entering "the Gloves," but put it off. Finally, at age thirty-two-his last year of eligibility-he vowed to fight, although he was an old man in a sport of teenagers and a light man who had to be even lighter (125 pounds) to fight others his size. So begins Anasi''s obsessive preparation for the Golden Gloves. He finds Milton, a wily and abusive trainer, and joins Milton''s "Supreme Team": a black teenager who used to deal guns in Harlem, a bus driver with five kids, a hard-hitting woman champion who becomes his sparring partner. Meanwhile, he observes the changing world of amateur boxing, in which investment bankers spar with ex-convicts and everyone dreads a fatal blow to the head. With the Supreme Team, he goes to the tournament, whose outcome, it seems, is rigged, like so much in boxing life today. Robert Anasi tells his story not as a journalist on assignment but as a man in the midst of one of the great adventures of his life.

Trinity of hats, scarves and gloves is a common ensemble that is used as modern fashion accessory by both men and women. It was a necessity to protect hands from gusty winds and keep them warm during cold-weather winters. The historic evolution and democratization development of gloves had an exotic trip with detours aplenty throughout the centuries. Gloves in fashion were an exclusive enterprise, a pursuit of the wealthy. Therefore, the use of materials, the length, and fabrication evolved from made at home into real industry. Eventually, an array of hand wear of different styles and colors became available for masses. In the intervening time, Europe countries were the ones that planted the seeds that would define fashion culture, chic and elegance for decades to come. Today, whatever its seasonal vagaries, gloves and mittens as fashion accessories have been a reflection of society as an industry, often stirring provocative debate. Is it art or craft? Who would wear elbow-long opera gloves? Is couture dead? Is department store obsolete?

The book begins with a brief history of movement studies and reviews the current central controversies in the area of control of movements with an emphasis on the equilibrium-point hypothesis. An operational definition of synergy is introduced and a method of analysis of synergies is described based on the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis. Further this method is used to characterize synergies in a variety of tasks including such common motor tasks as standing, pointing, reaching, standing-up, and manipulation of hand-held objects. Applications of this method to movements by persons with neurological disorders, persons with atypical development and healthy elderly persons are illustrated, as well as changes in motor synergies with practice. Possible neurophysiological mechanisms of synergies are also discussed with the focus on such conspicuous structures as the spinal cord, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, and the cortex of the large hemispheres.

The synergistic actions of the contact forces, defined as kinetic synergy, were investigated in three orthogonal spaces: radial, tangential, and vertical to the circle edge during a circle drawing task. We employed varying directional (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) and pacing (self-paced vs. external-paced) conditions.

This book successfully conceptualizes, defines, and constructs mathematically rigorous, computer-based tools for the assessment of network performance and efficiency, along with robustness and vulnerability analysis. The result is a thorough exploration that promotes an understanding of the critical infrastructure of today''s network systems, from congested urban transportation networks and supply chain networks under disruption to financial networks and the Internet. The authors approach the analyses by abstracting not only topological structures of networks, but also the behavior of network users, the demand for resources, the resulting flows, and the associated costs. Following an introduction to the fundamental methodologies and tools required for network analysis and network vulnerability, the book is organized into three self-contained parts: Part I—Network Fundamentals, Efficiency Measurement, and Vulnerability Analysis explores the theoretical and practical foundations for a new network efficiency measure in order to assess the importance of network components in various network systems. Methodologies for distinct decision-making behaviors are outlined, along with the tools for qualitative analysis, the algorithms for the computation of solutions, and a thorough discussion of the unified network efficient measure and network robustness with the unified measure. Part II—Applications and Extensions examines the efficiency changes and the associated cost increments after network components are eliminated or partially damaged. A discussion of the recently established connections between transportation networks and different critical networks is provided, which demonstrates how the new network measures and robustness indices can be applied to different supply chain, financial, and dynamic networks, including the Internet and electronic power networks. Part III—Mergers and Acquisitions, Network Integration, and Synergies reveals the connections between transportation networks and different network systems and quantifies the synergies associated with the network systems, from total cost reduction to environmental impact assessment. In the case of mergers and acquisitions, the focus is on supply chain networks. The authors outline a system-optimization perspective for supply chain networks and also formalize coalition formation using game theory with insights into the merger paradox. With its numerous network examples and real-world applications, Fragile Networks: Identifying Vulnerabilities and Synergies in an Uncertain World is an excellent book for courses in network science, transportation science, operations management, and financial networks at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the areas of applied mathematics, computer science, operations research, management science, finance, and economics, as well as industrial, systems, and civil engineering.

This series of studies has five main objectives: to quantify multi-digit synergies during actions with an explicit rotational component; to test the hypothesis that multi-digit synergies allow the stabilization of both total force (FTOT) and total moment of force (MTOT); to explore the effect of healthy ageing on multi-finger synergies stabilizing FTOT and MTOT; to describe the variance structure of elemental variables (finger modes) with respect to stabilization of FTOT or MTOT; and to examine hierarchies of multi-digit synergies during rotational actions performed with a hand-held object. A series of experiments within a range of tasks including isometric four-finger pressing tasks and free rotation of a hand-held object in 3D space resulted in several main conclusions. First, young subjects showed a strong moment-stabilizing synergy but not a force-stabilizing synergy in both stationary and non-stationary accurate moment-production tasks. The presence of multi-finger synergies stabilizing MTOT could be viewed as a default conditioned by everyday tasks. Second, flexible combinations of commands to fingers were found that satisfied both resultant force and moment of force constraints. Third, adding a secondary moment constraint did not interfere with the force stabilizing synergy. Two co-existing synergies stabilizing two performance variables simultaneously without an interaction confirmed the principle of superposition. These results emphasize a major advantage of using multi-finger synergies as compared to finding unique optimal solutions, namely the possibility to perform secondary tasks without detrimental effects on a primary task. During rotation of the hand-held object, the negative co-variation among elemental variables (forces produced by individual digits) stabilizing their combined output was observed at the hierarchically higher level (virtual finger and thumb level), but not at the lower level (individual finger level). At both levels, elemental moments of force negatively co-varied across trials, only during steady-states and this co-variation disappeared during the object rotation. These findings suggest that synergies at two levels of a control hierarchy can co-exist but that there is also a trade-off between synergies at the two levels. Finally, elderly persons showed significantly lower indices of synergies stabilizing the moment of force as compared to the young persons. These age-related differences might be causally related to the documented impairment of the hand function with age. This research line contributes to the current understanding of the hand control in healthy persons, the impaired hand function in the elderly, and has implications for hand rehabilitation following neurological disorders, trauma, or healthy aging.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '143', '2008', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vwzUeIWcascC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Control of Rotational Hand Actions by Multi-digit Synergies')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

This important book presents an in-depth analysis of the viability under Community law of traditional sports regulations such as transfer rules and nationality clausesboth sets of rules seriously compromised by the Bosman case of 1995. The author asks in particular whether certain rules elaborated by sporting associations can withstand the test of compatibility with the free movement provisions of the EC Treaty. In the light of Bosman, he also rigorously investigates: whether valuable arguments exist for keeping certain sporting rules and practices entirely outside the scope of the EC Treaty; and whether the private nature of sporting clubs constitutes a stumbling block for the application of the relevant free movement rules. Practical Regulation of the Mobility of Sportsmen in the EU Post Bosman comes at a moment when clarification of where this complex and contentious matter currently lies is essential if we are to gauge where it is going. The topic is of special and increasing interest, as official declarations on sport were attached to the Treaties of both Amsterdam and Nice. And, if the draft Constitution for Europe actually enters into force, sport will even become an official area of Union policy. This trend confirms the value and significance of this ground-breaking book for practitioners, policymakers, and regulators in the burgeoning field of sports law.

Over time, credit ratings have gradually taken on an expanding role, both in the United States and abroad and in official financial market regulation as well as in private capital market decisions. However, in 1999 the Bank for International Settlements (through its Committee on Banking Supervision) proposed rule changes that would provide an explicit role for credit ratings in determining a bank''s required regulatory risk capital. Once implemented, this BIS proposal (often referred to as Basel 2) would vastly elevate the importance of credit ratings by linking the required measure of bank capital to the credit rating of the bank''s obligors. With these regulatory changes under active discussion, research into the role for ratings and rating agencies in the global financial system is particularly apropos. Ratings, Rating Agencies and the Global Financial System brings together the research of economists at New York University and the University of Maryland, along with those from the private sector, government bodies, and other universities. The first section of the volume focuses on the historical origins of the credit rating business and its present day industrial organization structure. The second section presents several empirical studies crafted largely around individual firm-level or bank-level data. These studies examine (a) the relationship between ratings and the default and recovery experience of corporate borrowers, (b) the comparability of credit ratings made by domestic and foreign rating agencies, and (c) the usefulness of financial market indicators for rating banks, among other topics.

Distributed databases and the infrastructure needed to support them have been well studied. However, this book is the first to address distributed database interoperability by examining the successes and failures, various approaches, infrastructures, and trends of the field. A gap exists in the way that these systems have been investigated by real practitioners. This gap is more pronounced than usual, partly because of the way businesses operate, the systems they have, and the difficulties created by systems'' autonomy and heterogeneity. Telecommunications firms, for example, must deal with an increased demand for automation while at the same time continuing to function at their current level. While academics are focusing on investigating differences between distributed databases, federated databases, heterogeneous databases, and, more generally, among loosely connected and tightly coupled systems, those who have to deal with real problems right away know that the only relevant research is the one that will ensure that their system works to produce reasonably correct results. Interconnecting Heterogeneous Information Systems covers the underlying principles and infrastructures needed to realize truly global information systems. The book discusses technologies related to middleware, the Web, workflows, transactions, and data warehousing. It also overviews architectures with a discussion of critical issues. The book gives an overview of systems that can be viewed as learning platforms. While these systems do not translate to successful commercial realities, they push the envelope in terms of research. Successful commercial systems have benefited from the experiments conducted in these prototypes. The book includes two case studies based on the authors'' own work.

Men''s headwear includes feather-trimmed turbans, soldiers'' helmets, cowboy hats and top hats, derbies and boaters, berets, sombreros, and Homburgs.

What man, woman, or child of the 1890s could resist these offerings of the Montgomery Ward catalogue, the one book that was read avidly, year after year, by millions of Americans on farms and in small towns across the nation? The Montgomery Ward catalogue provides one of the few irrefutably accurate pictures of what life was "really like" in the gay nineties, for it described and illustrated almost anything that anybody could possibly need or want in the way of "store-bought" goods. In fact, in that pre-department store era, it was usually the only source for such goods. Imagine if Montgomery Ward had issued an illustrated catalogue in the days of Louis XIV, or Elizabeth I, or Charlemagne: what insights would we have into the daily life of the "common folk," the farmers and shopkeeper, housewives and schoolchildren . . . what sources of information for historians and scholars, collectors and dealers, what models for artists and designers. In 1895, Montgomery Ward was the oldest, largest, and most representative mail-order house in the country. The brainchild of a former traveling salesman, it issued its first catalogue in 1872, a one-page listing of items. By 1895, the catalogue, reprinted here, had grown to 624 pages and listed some 25,000 items, almost all of them illustrated with live drawings. Montgomery Ward was by then a multi-million dollar business that profoundly affected the American economy; and since it reached the most isolated farms and backwoods cabins, its effect on American culture was almost as great. Now once again available, it is our truest, most unbiased record of the spirit of the 1890s. An introduction on the history of the Montgomery Ward Company and its catalogue has been prepared especially for this edition by Boris Emmet, Ph.D. (Johns Hopkins), a foremost expert on retail merchandising.

Drawing on a variety of sources including college archives and the Public Record Office, Rogers documents the fluctuating prices of commodities such as livestock, wheat, hay, wool, textiles and labour in a time of great economic change, when the growing economy of the early middle ages was shaken by famine and the Black Death, and then gradually recovered towards the Agrarian Revolution. First published in 1902 (completed and edited by Rogers'' son), this two-part volume presents in Part 1 data from 1703 to 1793, showing the prices of a range of products; Part 2 consists of further documents collected by Rogers for the work.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '620', '2011-08', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HJBYH5oLZ8YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'A History of Agriculture and Prices in England')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Can’t resist the creamy smoothness of butter? Blame Darwinian natural selection. Crave the immediate zing of sweets? They bathe your brain in a seductive high. Enjoy the savory flavors of grilled meat? So did your ancestor Homo erectus. Coffee? You had to overcome your hardwired aversion to its hint of bitterness and learn to like it. Taste is a whole-body experience, and breakthroughs in genetics and microbiology are casting light not only on the experience of french fries and foie gras, but on the mysterious interplay of body, brain, and mind. Reporting from kitchens, supermarkets, farms, restaurants, huge food corporations, and science labs, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist John McQuaid tells the story of the still-emerging concept of flavor and how our sense of taste will evolve in the coming decades. Tasty explains why children have bizarre and stubborn tastes, how the invention of cooking changed our brains and physiology, why artificial sweeteners never taste quite right, why name brands really do taste better, how a 100,000-year-old walkabout by early humans is responsible for George H.W. Bush’s broccoli-hatred, why “supertasters” like salt, and why “nontasters” are more likely to be alcoholics. “A fascinating story with a beginning some half a billion years ago…McQuaid’s tale is about science, but also about culture, history and, one senses, our future” (Scientific American).

"Stay Out of Politics," which begins with the moral questions that Aronson confronted in his decision to go, is a reaffirmation of the necessity for majority rule and the abolition of apartheid. Amidst the pressure of widespread talk of an academic boycott of South Africa, Aronson decided to lecture there as a contribution to the struggle for majority rule. He decided to become mobilized as a philosopher and activist by engaging in the effort close at hand rather than settling for a distant and comfortable protest by avoidance. Along with his visa, Aronson was given the following warning by a consular officer: "Stay out of politics!" Believing that philosophy not only has a role to play but that it can, and must, involve itself in the vital social and political issues of our time, Aronson equally discovered that in South Africa politics is everywhere and inescapable. The lectures Aronson delivered focused on the meaning of progress and hope, on the threat—and experience—of disaster today, and on our responsibility to join the struggle for a humane and rational world. Two of the most provocative lectures are included here, the first a discussion of the Holocaust that has direct and intentional applications to the current situation in South Africa. The second lecture, in memory of the assassinated political philosopher Richard Turner, is a sketch of Aronson''s philosophy of hope as seen from within the South African context. Despite the limitations of teaching under possible surveillance in a revolutionary situation, Aronson witnessed the social reality of apartheid and heard the voices of its victims. Aronson''s love for the South African people motivated him to write this powerful account. He presents a lecturer''s tour of South Africa: the experiences that both confirmed his belief in the urgent need for majority rule but also revealed the complexities of the society that seeks to continue apartheid through all reforms; and his philosopher''s reflections upon returning to the United States on the irrationality of apartheid and the ambiguities of the struggle to end it.

The book opens with an overview to orient readers to South Africa’s historical inheritance. A look back at the presidential inaugurations of Nelson Mandela and Jacob Zuma and Mandela’s funeral illustrates some of the ways South Africa has indeed changed since 1994. Reviewing current demographic trends, Campbell highlights the persistent consequences of apartheid. He goes on to consider education, health, and current political developments, including land reform, with an eye on how South Africa’s democracy is responding to associated thorny challenges.

He analyses the relation of fear and brutality in small farming communities and demonstrates that, contrary to previous assumptions, small-scale slavery produced conditions as severe as those experienced in the large-scale slave-holding systems of the Deep South.

Our governments are corrupt and the opposing parties pointlessly similar. Our culture is filled with vacuity and pap, and we are told there’s nothing we can do: “It’s just the way things are.” In this book, Russell Brand hilariously lacerates the straw men and paper tigers of our conformist times and presents, with the help of experts as diverse as Thomas Piketty and George Orwell, a vision for a fairer, sexier society that’s fun and inclusive. You have been lied to, told there’s no alternative, no choice, and that you don’t deserve any better.

Fortunately for bounty hunter Stephanie Plum, Larry is just stupid enough to attempt almost the exact same crime again.

It’s going to be hard for Stephanie to keep her hands off all that ice cream, and even harder for her to keep her hands off Ranger. It’s also going to be hard to explain to Trenton’s hottest cop, Joe Morelli, why she is spending late nights with Ranger, late nights with Lula and Randy Briggs—who are naked and afraid—and late nights keeping tabs on Grandma Mazur and her new fella.

Watch out, world. Here comes Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie''s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She''s a product of the "burg," a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Now Stephanie''s all grown up and out on her own, living five miles from Mom and Dad''s, doing her best to sever the world''s longest umbilical cord. Her mother is a meddler, and her grandmother is a few cans short of a case. Out of work and out of money, with her Miata repossessed and her refrigerator empty, Stephanie blackmails her bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, fearless bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli is also the irresistible macho pig who took Stephanie''s virginity at age sixteen and then wrote the details on the bathroom wall of Mario''s Sub Shop. There''s still powerful chemistry between these two, so the chase should be interesting. It could also be extremely dangerous, especially when Stephanie encounters a heavyweight title contender who likes to play rough. Benito Ramirez is known for his brutality to women. At the very least, his obsession with Stephanie complicates her manhunt and brings terror and uncertainty into her life. At worst, it could lead to murder.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '288', '1999-02-24', '3502', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iuc9opwJ7awC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'One For The Money')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

They’re wrong. When University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack interviewed Helaine Olen, an award-winning financial journalist and the author of the bestselling Pound Foolish, he made an off­hand suggestion: everything you need to know about managing your money could fit on an index card. To prove his point, he grabbed a 4" x 6" card, scribbled down a list of rules, and posted a picture of the card online. The post went viral.

While most of these organizations have no direct connection to human rights issues, their participation in broader IGO networks has important implications for the human rights practices of their member states. Featuring a rigorous empirical analysis, Transmitting Rights shows that countries tend to adopt similar human rights practices to those of their IGO partners, whether for better or worse. Greenhill argues that IGOs constitute a tightly-woven fabric of ties between states and that this network provides an important channel through which states can influence the behavior of others. Indeed, his analysis suggests that a policy of isolating "rogue" states is probably self-defeating given that this will reduce their exposure to some of the more positive IGO-based influences on their human rights.

Although there are no known examples of arch dams which have been seriously damaged by earthquakes, the need for more realistic seismic analyses is now well recognized, not only for new dams but especially in the context of the safety evaluation of existing dams. Fortunately, with the finite element method, engineers have a powerful tool for modeling the complex geometry and the nonlinear material behavior of a dam. However, there is still a major complication in the analysis procedure, namely the interaction of the dam with the reservoir and with the foundation during an earthquake. Interaction is a wave propagation problem involving transmitting boundaries. The State of the Art in engineering practice is to neglect wave propagation by modeling the water as incompressible and the foundation as massless. More advanced analysis methods using compressible water and foundation with mass have been available for some time. However, these methods are restricted to linear models, because they work in the frequency domain. On the other hand, there are also advanced nonlinear models for dams, but they can only be used in the time domain, usually with simple transmitting boundaries. In this report, which is based on an a doctoral thesis, rigorous transmitting boundaries in the time domain are developed which permit combining compressible water with n- linear dam behavior.

The second edition features a new introduction by Robert Allen that includes a discussion of the political economy of commercial television. Two new essays have been added--one an assessment of postmodernism and television, the other an analysis of convergence and divergence among the essays--and the original essays have been substantially revised and updated with an international audience in mind. Sixty-one new television stills illustrate the text. Each essay lays out the general tenets of its particular approach, discusses television as an object of analysis within that critical framework, and provides extended examples of the types of analysis produced by that critical approach. Case studies range from Rescue 911 and Twin Peaks to soap operas, music videos, game shows, talk shows, and commericals. Channels of Discourse, Reassembled suggests new ways of understanding relationships among television programs, between viewing pleasure and narrative structure, and between the world in front of the television set and that represented on the screen. The collection also addresses the qualities of popular television that traditional aesthetics and quantitative media research have failed to treat satisfactorily, including its seriality, mass production, and extraordinary popularity.

During the past decade there has been a proliferation of research in the area of bandwidth-efficient coded-modulation techniques. The primary advantage of these schemes over modulation schemes employing traditional error correcting codes is their ability to improve the performance of the communication system without bandwidth expansion. This property makes them a suitable choice for channels which are limited in both power and bandwidth. A typical example of such channels is a mobile satellite channel, where it is desired to accommodate a large number of users in a given bandwidth with a power which is constrained by the physical size of the satellite and by the vehicle''s antenna.

The purpose of this book is to provide a gentle and instructionally organized introduction to the field of data science and machine learning, with a focus on building and deploying predictive models. The book also provides a thorough overview of the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning service using task oriented descriptions and concrete end-to-end examples, sufficient to ensure the reader can immediately begin using this important new service. It describes all aspects of the service from data ingress to applying machine learning and evaluating the resulting model, to deploying the resulting model as a machine learning web service. Finally, this book attempts to have minimal dependencies, so that you can fairly easily pick and choose chapters to read. When dependencies do exist, they are listed at the start and end of the chapter. The simplicity of this new service from Microsoft will help to take Data Science and Machine Learning to a much broader audience than existing products in this space.

Stone Barrington hasn''t heard from his cousin, Dick Stone, in years-though he has fond memories of a teenage summer spent at his house in Maine. Then, Lance Cabot of the CIA interrupts an otherwise pleasant meal at Elaine''s with news of Dick''s death-apparently by his own hands. It seems that Dick Stone, a quiet family man who doubled as a CIA agent, methodically executed his wife, daughter, and then himself-or did he? What would cause a loving father and husband to murder his family as they slept? Before his death, Dick had appointed Stone executor of his will, giving him full control of the disposition of a sizable family estate. Was Dick preparing for his suicide, or forewarning Stone of his murder? With the help of his ex-partner, Dino, and his friend Holly Barker, Stone must settle the estate and piece together the elusive facts of his cousin''s life and death as a CIA operative.

K. Ross Toole has chosen Montana for this purpose, and the brilliant success of his achievement must be apparent to all who read these pages. He has consciously avoided a systematic presentation of the history of this "uncommon land," Instead, he has chosen to put the great and many of the smaller but significant episodes of a century and a half into new perspective. The record, in its colorful and romantic aspects, stretches from the days of Lewis and Clark; and in its more recent aspects, from the subjugation of the Indian to the predominance of big mining and timber enterprises. The resulting portrait is sharply drawn by a man who knows not only how to interpret the remote and recent past but how to write with great effect. Montana is best remembered by most Americans as the state in which the Indian played his last dramatic role with the annihilation of General George Armstrong Custer. But it was also the area in which the fur trade had its roots; where the sheepherders and the cattlemen vied with each other for the right to graze the land; where the "honyockers" tried-and often failed to master the land and the seasons; where copper interests have played a powerful role in politics and in the lives of the people; and where, only recently, the oil industry has followed the boom-and-bust cycle so well known in the state. This story of Montana points up particularly the position which is and has been occupied by the state in relation to the nation as a whole.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '288', '1984-03-01', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2PuBxozvcTQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Montana')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

It argues that enhancing the access to justice in a multidimensional sense can potentially offer an effective means of boosting consumer confidence. It introduces a conceptual framework for a multidimensional approach to access to justice in the context of consumer protection, describing the various reasonable criteria needed to satisfy consumer demands in B2C e-commerce. The framework, which reflects all essential aspects of consumers’ expectations when they engage in online transactions, provides a benchmark for the evaluation of various consumer protection mechanisms. Based on an analysis of different mechanisms and using the framework’s criteria, the practice of private ordering, which does not rely on the creation of rules of law but rather on the use of technology as a solution, appears to offer a meaningful way to enhance access to justice in B2C e-commerce. However, though private ordering holds considerable potential, certain weaknesses still need to be eliminated. This book demonstrates how private ordering can be successfully implemented with the help of an intermediary, a neutral third party that plays an integral part in the collaborative task of facilitating various aspects of private ordering, thus helping to limit the risks of failure and ensuring a fairer market setting. In order to move forward, it argues that the state, with its wealth of material resources and incentive options, is the institution best suited to acting as an intermediary in facilitating private ordering. This promising proposal can improve consumer protection, which will in turn boost consumer confidence.​', DEFAULT, '143.2', '316', '2014-11-17', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=loZxBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Access to Justice in Transnational B2C E-Commerce')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

While the focus of this part of the analysis lies on factors showing significant correlation coefficients in relation to the research topic, this does not mean that the non-correlated factors are not of importance or somewhat connected. The statistical measurements may not be suitable for this type of analysis, survey results may be misleading or the situation will have changed in the last two years after the investigation. On the other hand, the observed correlations do not necessarily equal a causal relationship and the high complex matter can not be explained by single variables as influence factors. The conducted correlation analysis only serves as an indicator for potential influence factors or accelerators and has to be carefully evaluated. Keeping these considerations in mind, the statistical analysis within the scope of this masters dissertation will support the following conclusions and interpretations. First of all, computer usage and skills as well as internet usage and skills need to be on a high level in a country to facilitate financial B2C e-commerce. Residents of countries with higher levels for the subject of examination will probably already have gained adequate skills, as indicated by a medium strong negative relation to computer courses taken in the last three months and other online activities such as online information search and online banking positively correlated. While online banking is partially included in the variable e_comm representing financial B2C e-commerce through customer s usage of online financial services, this particular result may not be totally conclusive. However, it seems logical that consumers with good computer and internet skills also spending a lot of time with advanced activities on the internet may also engage in financial B2C e-commerce. This assumption narrows down the target group and excludes a certain clientele from online product offers of financial institutions - banks will need to adapt their web portals accordingly, set up initiatives improving computer and web skills of their consumers and meet their consumers on the internet, e.g. with advertising while they are using search engines. Practical evidence supporting these interpretations can be found in several examples of [...]', DEFAULT, '52.79', '229', '2010-04-27', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rX9kAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'European B2C E-Commerce in the Banking Sector')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

A typical bonus program of this kind is Payback. The problem is that still there is little known about why customers participate in bonus programs and that especially the crucial aspect rewards management (also bonus management) is the blind spot of the marketing theory on hand. On the background of high investments in bonus programs and their rewards on the one hand and unclear reasons for the different success of bonus sets on the other hand this is an unsatisfactory situation. The target is therefore to show how bonus programs work and how rewards management is integrated in such a bonus program. Furthermore it is the target to show how rewards management can contribute to program success, how a rewards concept has to be set up and which possibilities (e.g. type of reward) there are for setting up a successful bonus set. To reach this a compilation of the scattered but carefully selected information in marking literature, papers, articles and further sources also from non-economic ones like psychology, a systematization of the findings and drawing of conclusions from this gives a clearer picture and helps to give recommendations for setting up a successful rewards management. For backing up the findings the results of an especially therefore carried out online survey get used. The decision to start with a bonus program must be based on the likeliness of the expected benefits that can be higher perceived product value, customer satisfaction, loyalty, from that customer equity and company value and cost savings as well as additional sales and cross and up-selling. Of course these benefits are strongly influenced by the customer retention potential of the bonus program set-up. The customer retention can be influenced through bonus programs by both psychological causes (e.g. satisfaction) as well as by rewarding the customer for certain behaviour. Because everybody can reward the customers the type of bonus / reward is decisive. The type of reward belongs to the burning mechanism of a bonus program. In a token economy rewards can be redeemed for collected points (artificial currency). Points and point issuance rules are part of the earning mechanism and are closely linked.

Some countries experience tens of thousands of consumer arbitrations each year while others significantly limit or even entirely exclude arbitration in consumer disputes. Many countries have undergone certain reforms in consumer disputes, the main objective of which is the protection of consumers in arbitration. The controversial variable is the degree of protection to be afforded to the consumer, both under the applicable substantive law and in procedural terms. These are the main issues addressed in this book. Apart from the key topic, the author has extensively elaborated on certain fundamental categories such as public interest and public policy (all primarily in connection to the procedural mechanisms of consumer protection); he has also analyzed the applicable European law and the case law of the ECJ and offered an overview of the individual systems employed in both European and non-European countries (especially the USA and Canada). An integral part of this book is an extensive comparison and analysis of the voluminous case law (several tens of decisions), with reference to more than three hundred other available court decisions. The book also focuses on the position of the consumer in the individual procedural stages, the intervention of courts in arbitration motivated by consumer protection, the individual stages of proceedings, recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards rendered in consumer disputes, both in domestic context and in the international milieu etc. The international practice significantly influences the domestic environment in the individual countries. The key issue in the EU countries is, in principle, the enforcement of EU standards which influence the domestic models of consumer protection, primarily in connection with the autonomous EU interpretation of a number of institutions. Many related issues have not yet been addressed in the case law of certain states. In fact, some of them have never even been discovered. Besides, the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards requires, inter alia, the compliance with extra-EU international obligations binding on the individual states. And finally, arbitration is not regulated by the EU law, as opposed to consumer protection. Naturally, arbitration is to a significant extent regulated by international law. This results in conflicts between national, international interpretation and interpretation pursuant to the EU law, where the circumstances allow to apply the EU law. This book is intended for all readers who have any experience with enforcement of consumer rights, as well as for all professionals dealing with arbitration in general. It is therefore intended for general legal practitioners, lawyers, primarily arbitrators, of course, but also for judiciary dealing with civil matters in the broadest sense. Apart from a voluminous case law, the book quotes from a number of domestic and foreign sources and, above all, offers a long list of structured bibliography and detailed subject index, as well as a table of states, table of cases and list of legal sources.

For decades people have unquestioningly accepted the idea that our goal is to preserve nature in its pristine, pre-human state. But many scientists have come to see this as an outdated dream that thwarts bold new plans to save the environment and prevents us from having a fuller relationship with nature. Humans have changed the landscapes they inhabit since prehistory, and climate change means even the remotest places now bear the fingerprints of humanity. Emma Marris argues convincingly that it is time to look forward and create the "rambunctious garden," a hybrid of wild nature and human management. In this optimistic book, readers meet leading scientists and environmentalists and visit imaginary Edens, designer ecosystems, and Pleistocene parks. Marris describes innovative conservation approaches, including rewilding, assisted migration, and the embrace of so-called novel ecosystems. Rambunctious Garden is short on gloom and long on interesting theories and fascinating narratives, all of which bring home the idea that we must give up our romantic notions of pristine wilderness and replace them with the concept of a global, half-wild rambunctious garden planet, tended by us.', DEFAULT, '9.59', '224', '2011-09-06', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vW_bWhe5rwIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Rambunctious Garden')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Hall effect sensors, based on a magnetic phenomena, are one of the most commonly used sensing technologies today. In the 1970s it became possible to build Hall effect sensors on integrated circuits with onboard signal processing circuitry, vastly reducing the cost and enabling widespread practical use. One of the first major applications was in computer keyboards, replacing mechanical contacts. Hundreds of millions of these devices are now manufactured each year for use in a great variety of applications, including automobiles, computers, industrial control systems, cell phones, and many others. The importance of these sensors, however, contrasts with the limited information available. Many recent advances in miniaturization, smart sensor configurations, and networkable sensor technology have led to design changes and a need for reliable information. Most of the technical information on Hall effect sensors is supplied by sensor manufacturers and is slanted toward a particular product line. System design and control engineers need an independent, readable source of practical design information and technical details that is not product- or manufacturer-specific and that shows how Hall effect sensors work, how to interface to them, and how to apply them in a variety of uses. This book covers: • the physics behind Hall effect sensors • Hall effect transducers • transducer interfacing • integrated Hall effect sensors and how to interface to them • sensing techniques using Hall effect sensors • application-specific sensor ICs • relevant development and design tools This second edition is expanded and updated to reflect the latest advances in Hall effect devices and applications!

Checkoffs - mandatory assessments of producers - fund generic advertising and promotion programs to expand and develop commodity markets. In Commodity Advertising, Olan D. Forker and Ronald W. Ward develop the terminology and set forth the economic theory of commodity advertising, as well as the legal and industrial structures necessary to underwriting commodity programs. Forker and Ward offer methods for evaluating the economic effectiveness of commodity programs, suggest techniques for integrating advertising and promotion expenditures into demand analysis, and propose a new method for estimating the functional relationship between advertising expenditures and expected sales response - one that provides a more realistic estimate of the shape of the advertising response function. They also present case studies on the advertising programs for fluid milk, beef, apples, citrus, wool, fresh tomato, catfish, potatoes, soybean, cheese, and fats and oils. Commodity Advertising demonstrates that like their brand counterparts, generic advertising programs do have a positive impact on consumer demand. While the impact varies among commodity groups, research indicates that well planned and executed generic advertising can yield benefits to the producers who fund the programs as well as the processors and consumers of the commodity. The authors treat advertising as information, and they present methods to estimate the value of this information to consumers and to the commodity industry. In general, advertising yields greater benefits to the producers of the commodity when the industry''s supply response is inelastic. But many other factors, including product quality, funding base, pricing, available substitutes, and consumer preferences influence the ability of commodity advertising programs to be effective. The authors discuss the influence on commodity demand of all these factors.

In it he shares his most treasured memories and never-before-seen photographs as he looks back on an extraordinary life on and off the court. Hailed by many as the greatest coach in the history of American sports, John Wooden is as famous for his personal philosophy as he is for his career achievements. He inspired, guided, and motivated generations of fans with his bestselling books on leadership, values, family, and the true meaning of success. Coach Wooden wrote his final book, The Wisdom of Wooden: My Century On and Off the Court, in the last months before his death. Filled with his most treasured memories and more than 100 photographs, many never-before seen, it captures a life spent teaching, guiding, and serving others. Starting with his father’s now-famous 7 Point Creed—including “Make Each Day Your Masterpiece,” “Help Others,” and “Be True to Yourself,”—Coach Wooden affirms the principles to true success that helped him become an All American at Purdue University, a winning coach at Indiana State University, and an iconic sports figure at UCLA. Yet anyone who knows John Wooden knows his record on the court was only part of the story. In The Wisdom of Wooden the legendary coach offers readers a rare glimpse not just behind the scenes but inside the man; not just on the court but in the huddles; not just his maxims but his poems, those he wrote and those he loved; not just the people he inspired, but the family, friends, and fans who inspired him; not just the lessons he taught but the lessons he learned; not just what was on his mind but what was in his heart. Ultimately it was the life he lived that served as a model for his greatest lesson of all: a deep commitment to family, friends, and faith—the bedrock values of the man we all called, “Coach.” Praise for John Wooden “The Wisdom of Wooden has given me the life that I have . . . Thanks, Coach, for your faith and patience.” —Bill Walton “The Wisdom of Wooden is a lifetime of Coach Wooden’s ideas on how to live life without sacrificing your moral principles. His life is a prime example of how this can be done--one that we can all learn from.” —Kareem Abdul-Jabbar “John Wooden sets an example for all of us by constantly striving to be the best in every aspect of his life. Throughout my life, I have found inspiration and direction in the Bible. Today, I also find inspiration and direction in the words of John Wooden.” —Tom Coughlin, Head Coach, New York Giants “One hundred years—what an amazing life. But here’s what''s even more amazing about John Wooden and the timeless verities his life has embodied. One hundred years from now they will still be talking about his accomplishments and his approach.” —Bob Costas "There has never been a finer man in American sports than John Wooden, or a finer coach." --Sports Illustrated', DEFAULT, '14.16', '80', '2010-09-03', '2', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=K8XkOepZZggC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Wisdom of Wooden: My Century On and Off the Court')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

At the same time, we’re expected to make more—and faster—decisions about our lives than ever before. No wonder, then, that the average American reports frequently losing car keys or reading glasses, missing appointments, and feeling worn out by the effort required just to keep up. But somehow some people become quite accomplished at managing information flow. In The Organized Mind, Daniel J. Levitin, PhD, uses the latest brain science to demonstrate how those people excel—and how readers can use their methods to regain a sense of mastery over the way they organize their homes, workplaces, and time. With lively, entertaining chapters on everything from the kitchen junk drawer to health care to executive office workflow, Levitin reveals how new research into the cognitive neuroscience of attention and memory can be applied to the challenges of our daily lives.

Many Americans are doubtful, and have withdrawn into apathy and cynicism. But thousands of others are not ready to give up on democracy just yet. Working outside the notice of the national media, ordinary citizens across the nation are meeting in living rooms, church basements, synagogues, and schools to identify shared concerns, select and cultivate leaders, and take action. Their goal is to hold big government and big business accountable. In this important new book, Jeffrey Stout bears witness to the successes and failures of progressive grassroots organizing, and the daunting forces now arrayed against it. Stout tells vivid stories of people fighting entrenched economic and political interests around the country. From parents and teachers striving to overcome gang violence in South Central Los Angeles, to a Latino priest north of the Rio Grande who brings his parish into a citizens'' organization, to the New Orleans residents who get out the vote by taking a jazz band through streets devastated by Hurricane Katrina, Stout describes how these ordinary people conceive of citizenship, how they acquire and exercise power, and how religious ideas and institutions contribute to their successes.

The first develops a sophisticated approach to negotiation for executives, attorneys, diplomats -- indeed, for anyone who bargains or studies its challenges. The second offers a new and compelling vision of the successful manager: as a strong, often subtle negotiator, constantly shaping agreements and informal understandings throughout the complex web of relationships in an organization. Effective managers must be able to reach good formal accords such as contracts, out-of-court settlements, and joint venture agreements. Yet they also have to negotiate with others on whom they depend for results, resources, and authority. Whether getting fuller support from the marketing department, hammering out next year''s budget, or winning the approval for a new line of business, managers must be adept at advantageously working out and modifying understandings, resolving disputes, and finding mutual gains where interests and perceptions conflict. In such situations, The Manager as Negotiator shows how to creatively further the totality of one''s interests, including important relationships -- in a way that Richard Walton, Harvard Business School Professor of Organizational Behavior, describes as "sensitive to the nuances of negotiating in organizations" and "relentless and skillful in making systematic sense of the process." This book differs fundamentally from the recent spate of negotiation handbooks that tend to espouse one of two approaches: the competitive ("Get yours and most of theirs, too") or the cooperative ("Everyone can always win"). Transcending such cynical and naive views, the authors develop a comprehensive approach, based on strategies and tactics for productively managing the tension between the cooperation and competition that are both inherent in bargaining.

Being a man or a woman in your early sixties is different than it was a generation or two ago, at least for the more fortunate of us. We aren’t old…yet. But we sense it coming: Careers are winding down, kids are gone, parents are dying (friends, too), and our bodies are no longer youthful or even middle-aged. Learning to play tennis in your fifties is no small feat, but becoming a serious, competitive tennis player at the age of sixty is a whole other matter. It requires training the body to defy age, and to methodically build one’s game—the strokework, footwork, strategy, and mental toughness. Gerry Mazorati started playing the game seriously in his mid-fifties. He had the strong desire to lead an examined physical life, to push his body into the “encore” of middle age. In Late to the Ball Mazorati writes vividly about the difficulties, frustrations, and the triumphs of his becoming a seriously good tennis player. He takes on his quest with complete vigor and absolute determination to see it through, providing a rich, vicarious experience involving the science of aging, his existential battle with time, and the beautiful, mysterious game of tennis.

Gaul offers a riveting and sometimes shocking look inside the money culture of college football and how it has come to dominate a surprising number of colleges and universities. Over the past decade college football has not only doubled in size, but its elite programs have become a $2.5-billion-a-year entertainment business, with lavishly paid coaches, lucrative television deals, and corporate sponsors eager to slap their logos on everything from scoreboards to footballs and uniforms. Profit margins among the top football schools range from 60% to 75%—results that dwarf those of such high-profile companies as Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft—yet thanks to the support of their football-mad representatives in Congress, teams aren’t required to pay taxes. In most cases, those windfalls are not passed on to the universities themselves, but flow directly back into their athletic departments. College presidents have been unwilling or powerless to stop a system that has spawned a wildly profligate infrastructure of coaches, trainers, marketing gurus, and a growing cadre of bureaucrats whose sole purpose is to ensure that players remain academically eligible to play. From the University of Oregon’s lavish $42 million academic center for athletes to Alabama coach Nick Saban’s $7 million paycheck—ten times what the school pays its president, and 70 times what a full-time professor there earns—Gaul examines in depth the extraordinary financial model that supports college football and the effect it has had not only on other athletic programs but on academic ones as well.

As the principalship has evolved and grown, so have the expectations of it. With that in mind, ASCD developed the Principal Leadership Development Framework (PLDF). The PLDF establishes a clear and concise definition of leadership and includes clear targets that support the ongoing growth and development of leaders. Using the Framework, principals will learn to capitalize on their leadership roles: * Principal as Visionary * Principal as Instructional Leader * Principal as Engager * Principal as Learner and Collaborator The PLDF also offers 17 criteria of effective practice that allow leaders to focus on behaviors that have the greatest direct effect on the culture and status of learning and teaching. Coupled with the PLDF are tools for self-reflection that help principals identify and strengthen their reflective habits.

Even then, however, martial use was only one aspect of Iron Shirt Chi Kung, and today its other aspects remain vitally significant for anyone seeking better health, a sound mind, and spiritual growth. In Iron Shirt Chi Kung Master Mantak Chia introduces this ancient practice that strengthens the internal organs, establishes roots to the earth’s energy, and unifies physical, mental, and spiritual health. Through a unique system of breathing exercises, he demonstrates how to permanently pack concentrated air into the connective tissues (the fasciae) surrounding vital organs, making them nearly impervious to injuries--a great benefit to athletes and other performers. He shows readers how once they root themselves in the earth they can direct its gravitational and healing power throughout their bone structure.

We hail them without thought after a wearying day at the office or an exuberant night on the town. And, undoubtedly, taxi drivers have stories to tell—of farcical local politics, of colorful passengers, of changing neighborhoods and clandestine shortcuts. No one knows a city’s streets—and thus its heart—better than its cabdrivers. And from behind the wheel of his taxi, Dmitry Samarov has seen more of Chicago than most Chicagoans will hope to experience in a lifetime. An artist and painter trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Samarov began driving a cab in 1993 to make ends meet, and he’s been working as a taxi driver ever since. In Hack: Stories from a Chicago Cab, he recounts tales that will delight, surprise, and sometimes shock the most seasoned urbanite. We follow Samarov through the rhythms of a typical week, as he waits hours at the garage to pick up a shift, ferries comically drunken passengers between bars, delivers prostitutes to their johns, and inadvertently observes drug deals. There are long waits with other cabbies at O’Hare, vivid portraits of street corners and their regular denizens, amorous Cubs fans celebrating after a game at Wrigley Field, and customers who are pleasantly surprised that Samarov is white—and tell him so. Throughout, Samarov’s own drawings—of his fares, of the taxi garage, and of a variety of Chicago street scenes—accompany his stories. In the grand tradition of Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, Mike Royko, and Studs Terkel, Dmitry Samarov has rendered an entertaining, poignant, and unforgettable vision of Chicago and its people.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '124', '2011-09-01', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=W10SwN7_HAkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Hack')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The rapid technological advancements, commercial initiatives, and market penetration of such commerce have made this sector of the gambling services industries extremely dynamic and potentially transformative in the years ahead. Demand for gambling services in the early 21 century and for the past half-century in the European Union – as well as in most other parts of the world – has been and is expanding rapidly, for a number of reasons. The commercial and government owned gaming industries of the European Union are organized under a wide variety of ownership regimes and market structures. Ownership and market structures are affected by numerous factors, including Member State laws and regulations; restrictions on product types, characteristics, points of sale, availability, and marketing effort; economies of scale; network effects; and impacts of new technologies. The overall gambling market in Europe is growing, both land-based and online. Lotteries and gambling machines remain the biggest sectors in the overall gambling market. While not all EU Member States have a legal definition of the concepts of “games of chance” and of “gambling”, in most jurisdictions a game of chance is defined as a game that offers an opportunity to compete for prizes, where success depends completely or predominantly on coincidence or an unknown future result and cannot be influenced by the player. At least one of the players loses his or her stake. The first important element characterising a game of chance is that of stake money or monetary value. The second essential characteristic of a game of chance is the element of chance. Success or loss must depend completely or predominantly on coincidence and not on abilities and knowledge. Success is considered to depend in any case on coincidence, if the relevant aspect is the occurrence of an uncertain event.

In one easy-to-use volume it provides: 1. the texts of the Public Sector Directive and the Utilities Directive, with the articles of these directives linked to the relevant Court of Justice case law; 2. in-depth analysis of 84 judgements rendered by the Court of Justice in connection with subject matter treated by the articles of the two directives; 3. the essential excerpts from the chronologically ordered judgments, with each excerpt preceded by an overview of the subject matter and points of law treated in the judgment; 4. pertinent passages of opinions of the Advocate General; 5. texts of supplementary legislation, including the relevant articles of the EC Treaty and interpretative communications and explanatory notes of the European Commission; and 6. an exhaustive subject index. By bringing the reader into direct contact with the relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice - which has been instrumental in interpreting the public procurement legal framework - the book clearly manifests the reality of public procurement in the European Union.

This book on the ''Utilities'' Directive 2004/17/EC is a companion to an earlier volume on the legislative history of Directive 2004/18/EC. This new volume gathers in one place all the relevant documents that led to the adoption of the Utilities Directive. In great detail this legislative history reveals such crucial elements and outcomes as the following: ports and airports as transport hubs of solid fuels; treatment of relevant WTO Agreements; confidentiality and security; works and service concessions; resale and leasing provisions; competition; communication of technical specifications; tax. environmental, and labour obligations; time limits; and design contests. Introducing the book are excerpts that give a general picture of the reasons that led to the intention to replace the earlier procurement directive for the utilities sectors (93/38/EEC). Then follow excerpts that give an insight into the drafting of the recitals in the Preamble, the articles, and the annexes. The book concludes with a chronological overview of the legislative documents associated with Directive 2004/17/EC and a Keyword Index. Along with its companion volume on Directive 2004/18/EC, this important book will be a powerful resource for lawyers and policymakers engaged in the practice and development of European procurement law.

In remote pockets of the Third World, a deadly virus is quietly sweeping through impoverished farming villages and shanty towns with frightening speed and potency. Meanwhile, in Washington, a three-word message left in a safe-deposit box may be the key to stopping the crisis—if, that is, Charles Mallory, a private intelligence contractor and former CIA operative, can decipher the puzzle before time runs out. What Mallory begins to discover are the traces of a secret war, with a bold objective—to create a new, technologically advanced society. With the help of his brother Jon, an investigative reporter, can he break the story to the world before it is too late—before a planned “humane depopulation” takes place? As the stakes and strategies of this secret war become more evident, the Mallory brothers find themselves in a complex game of wits with an enemy they can’t see: a new sort of superpower led by a brilliant, elusive tactician who believes that ends justify means.

Models are developed to describe the dynamics of drug resistance, immune responses, viral evolution and mutation, and to optimise the design of therapy and vaccines. - ;We know, down to the tiniest details, the molecular structure of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Yet despite this tremendous accomplishment, and despite other remarkable advances in our understanding of individual viruses and cells of the immune system, we still have no agreed understanding of the ultimate course and variability of the pathogenesis of AIDS. Gaps in our understanding like these impede our efforts towards developing effective therapies and preventive vaccines. Martin Nowak and Robert M May describe the emerging field of theoretical immunology in this accessible and well- written text. Using mathematical modelling techniques, the authors set out their ideas about how populations of viruses and populations of immune system cells may interact in various circumstances, and how infectious diseases spread within patients. They explain how this approach to understanding infectious diseases can reveal insights into the dynamics of viral and other infections, and the interactions between infectious agents and immune responses. The book is structured around the examples of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis B virus, although the approaches described will be more widely applicable. The authors use mathematical tools to uncover the detailed dynamics of the infection and the effects of antiviral therapy. Models are developed to describe the emergence of drug resistance, and the dynamics of immune responses, viral evolution, and mutation. The practical implications of this work for optimisation of the design of therapy and vaccines are discussed.

Weight loss is not the key to health, diet and exercise are not effective weight-loss strategies and fatness is not a death sentence. You’ve heard it before: there’s a global health crisis, and, unless we make some changes, we’re in trouble. That much is true—but the epidemic is NOT obesity. The real crisis lies in the toxic stigma placed on certain bodies and the impact of living with inequality—not the numbers on a scale. In a mad dash to shrink our bodies, many of us get so caught up in searching for the perfect diet, exercise program, or surgical technique that we lose sight of our original goal: improved health and well-being. Popular methods for weight loss don’t get us there and lead many people to feel like failures when they can’t match unattainable body standards. It’s time for a cease-fire in the war against obesity. Dr. Linda Bacon and Dr. Lucy Aphramor’s Body Respect debunks common myths about weight, including the misconceptions that BMI can accurately measure health, that fatness necessarily leads to disease, and that dieting will improve health.

Weight loss is not the key to health, diet and exercise are not effective weight-loss strategies and fatness is not a death sentence. You’ve heard it before: there’s a global health crisis, and, unless we make some changes, we’re in trouble. That much is true—but the epidemic is NOT obesity. The real crisis lies in the toxic stigma placed on certain bodies and the impact of living with inequality—not the numbers on a scale. In a mad dash to shrink our bodies, many of us get so caught up in searching for the perfect diet, exercise program, or surgical technique that we lose sight of our original goal: improved health and well-being. Popular methods for weight loss don’t get us there and lead many people to feel like failures when they can’t match unattainable body standards. It’s time for a cease-fire in the war against obesity. Dr. Linda Bacon and Dr. Lucy Aphramor’s Body Respect debunks common myths about weight, including the misconceptions that BMI can accurately measure health, that fatness necessarily leads to disease, and that dieting will improve health. They also help make sense of how poverty and oppression—such as racism, homophobia, and classism—affect life opportunity, self-worth, and even influence metabolism.

The act is supported by a substantial bureaucracy within the Department of Labor that has resisted all efforts at substantive modernization or reform. Today, the Davis-Bacon Act is the bedrock upon which stands one of the last bastions of private unionization in the construction industry. This book provides a compelling list of fifty-four separate reasons why the Davis-Bacon Act should be repealed. Thieblot deals with the history, purposes, and administrative concepts of prevailing wage laws, providing an overview of the act''s administration. He covers the survey and determination process, and delves into how the act is administered. Thieblot summarizes its direct and indirect costs, evaluates counterclaims on the economic impact of Davis-Bacon, and considers compromises short of full repeal. Also included are seven appendices that provide full support for the conclusions summarized in the main text. Thieblot documents a case against Davis-Bacon that is neither judgmental nor political, but he does question whether there is compelling public interest in maintaining a federal prevailing wage law. He puts forward a list of reasons why the Davis-Bacon Act should be repealed, making a convincing case that deserves action and not just simple consideration.

Weight loss is not the key to health, diet and exercise are not effective weight-loss strategies and fatness is not a death sentence. You’ve heard it before: there’s a global health crisis, and, unless we make some changes, we’re in trouble. That much is true—but the epidemic is NOT obesity. The real crisis lies in the toxic stigma placed on certain bodies and the impact of living with inequality—not the numbers on a scale. In a mad dash to shrink our bodies, many of us get so caught up in searching for the perfect diet, exercise program, or surgical technique that we lose sight of our original goal: improved health and well-being. Popular methods for weight loss don’t get us there and lead many people to feel like failures when they can’t match unattainable body standards. It’s time for a cease-fire in the war against obesity. Dr. Linda Bacon and Dr. Lucy Aphramor’s Body Respect debunks common myths about weight, including the misconceptions that BMI can accurately measure health, that fatness necessarily leads to disease, and that dieting will improve health. They also help make sense of how poverty and oppression—such as racism, homophobia, and classism—affect life opportunity, self-worth, and even influence metabolism. Body insecurity is rampant, and it doesn’t have to be. It’s time to overcome our culture’s shame and distress about weight, to get real about inequalities and health, and to show every body respect.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '240', '2014-09-02', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mqo3BAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Body Respect')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Margaret Atwood’s new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood''s riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake''s high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.

In 2007, Mary Anne returned from a humanitarian trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan suffering from what her doctors believed was a rare type of hepatitis. Months later she was diagnosed with a form of advanced pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal, often in six months or less. This is the inspiring true story of a son and his mother, who start a “book club” that brings them together as her life comes to a close. Over the next two years, Will and Mary Anne carry on conversations that are both wide-ranging and deeply personal, prompted by an eclectic array of books and a shared passion for reading. Their list jumps from classic to popular, from poetry to mysteries, from fantastic to spiritual. The issues they discuss include questions of faith and courage as well as everyday topics such as expressing gratitude and learning to listen. Throughout, they are constantly reminded of the power of books to comfort us, astonish us, teach us, and tell us what we need to do with our lives and in the world. Reading isn’t the opposite of doing; it’s the opposite of dying. Will and Mary Anne share their hopes and concerns with each other—and rediscover their lives—through their favorite books. When they read, they aren’t a sick person and a well person, but a mother and a son taking a journey together. The result is a profoundly moving tale of loss that is also a joyful, and often humorous, celebration of life: Will’s love letter to his mother, and theirs to the printed page.

Writing for both technical and nontechnical decision-makers, this book covers everything that impacts scalability, including architecture, processes, people, and organizations. Throughout, the authors address a broad spectrum of real-world challenges, from performance testing to IT governance. Using their tools and guidance, organizations can systematically overcome obstacles to scalability and achieve unprecedented levels of technical and business performance.

Not even the table of contents can show all the lessons contained within this book meant to help consumers fight all types of financial problems just as Danny Singh fights for his mother including avoiding a foreclosure, reclaiming a repossessed car, fixing credit, avoiding deceptive loans as well as checking accounts filled with fees, and getting denied credit applications approved. In response to the student loans crisis looming in America and as a community college student himself, Danny advocates going to a community or state college and doing the maximum number of classes is the best financial decision that can be made versus getting into $100,000 of debt. Without needing bogus and expensive credit repair agencies, Danny will emphasize the most effective debt repayment plans and methods to save money on everyday purchases allowing for consumers to be debt free in months instead of years. Besides student loan debt, Danny expresses credit unions are the solution for consumers to effectively pay off any type of debt such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Being free of debt will cause their insurance premiums to decrease and increase their chances of better employment. In addition, consumers will be able to enjoy lives free of bankruptcy. Saving for retirement and other financial goals will be a breeze. Despite the financial conditions of a consumer or the economy, perfect credit is never impossible and Danny proves this in Finance 101: The Whiz Kid’s Perfect Credit Guide!

While many studies have explained the causes of this decline, What Unions No Longer Do shows the broad repercussions of labor''s collapse for the American economy and polity. Organized labor was not just a minor player during the middle decades of the twentieth century, Jake Rosenfeld asserts. For generations it was the core institution fighting for economic and political equality in the United States. Unions leveraged their bargaining power to deliver benefits to workers while shaping cultural understandings of fairness in the workplace. What Unions No Longer Do details the consequences of labor''s decline, including poorer working conditions, less economic assimilation for immigrants, and wage stagnation among African-Americans. In short, unions are no longer instrumental in combating inequality in our economy and our politics, resulting in a sharp decline in the prospects of American workers and their families.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '288', '2014-02-10', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cZDzAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'What Unions No Longer Do')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

During this time, young men and women go away to college, travel abroad, begin careers, and enjoy social independence. This independent life stage has reduced parental control over the dating practices and mate selection of their children and has resulted in a sharp rise in interracial and same-sex unions--unions that were more easily averted by previous generations of parents. Complementing analysis of newly available census data from the entire twentieth century with in-depth interviews that explore the histories of families and couples, Rosenfeld proposes a conceptual model to explain many social changes that may seem unrelated but that flow from the same underlying logic.

When her great-great-aunt Rose (Rosie the Riveter) comes for a visit and mentions her one unfinished goal—to fly—Rosie sets to work building a contraption to make her aunt’s dream come true. But when her contraption doesn’t fly but rather hovers for a moment and then crashes, Rosie deems the invention a failure. On the contrary, Aunt Rose insists that Rosie’s contraption was a raging success: you can only truly fail, she explains, if you quit. From the powerhouse author-illustrator team of Iggy Peck, Architect comes Rosie Revere, Engineer, another charming, witty picture book about believing in yourself and pursuing your passion.

This new book does an outstanding job of filling in the knowledge and perspective that engineers must have to be good citizens in areas ranging from the environment, to intellectual property, to ensuring the health of the innovation ecosystem that has done so much for modern society. This is exactly the sort of book that engineers and those who work with them should read and discuss over pizza, coffee, or some other suitable, discussion-provoking consumable.” —John L. Hennessy, president, Stanford University “Citizen Engineer is the bible for the new era of socially responsible engineering. It’s an era where, as the authors show, engineers don’t just need to know more, they need to be more. The work is an inspiration, an exhortation, and a practical how-to guide. All engineers concerned with the impact of their work—and that should be all engineers—must read this book.” —Hal Abelson, professor of computer science and engineering, MIT “Code is law. Finally, a map to responsible law making. This accessible and brilliant book should be required of every citizen, and especially, the new citizen lawmakers we call engineers.” —Lawrence Lessig, director, Safra Center for Ethics, Harvard University, and cofounder, Creative Commons Being an engineer today means being far more than an engineer. You need to consider not only the design requirements of your projects but the full impact of your work—from an ecological perspective, an intellectual property perspective, a business perspective, and a sociological perspective. And you must coordinate your efforts with many other engineers, sometimes hundreds of them. In short, we’ve entered an age that demands socially responsible engineering on a whole new scale: The era of the Citizen Engineer. This engaging and thought-provoking book, written by computer industry luminaries David Douglas and Greg Papadopoulos, focuses on two topics that are becoming vitally important in the day-to-day work of engineers: eco engineering and intellectual property (IP).

The beaver is a keystone species—their skills as foresters and engineers create and maintain ponds and wetlands that increase biodiversity, purify water, and prevent large-scale flooding. Biologists have long studied their daily and seasonal routines, family structures, and dispersal patterns. As human development encroaches into formerly wild areas, property owners and government authorities need new, nonlethal strategies for dealing with so-called nuisance beavers. At the same time, the complex behavior of beavers intrigues visitors at parks and other wildlife viewing sites because it is relatively easy to observe.In an up-to-date, exhaustively illustrated, and comprehensive book on beaver biology and management, Dietland Müller-Schwarze and Lixing Sun gather a wealth of scientific knowledge about both the North American and Eurasian beaver species. The Beaver is designed to satisfy the curiosity and answer the questions of anyone with an interest in these animals, from students who enjoy watching beaver ponds at nature centers to homeowners who hope to protect their landscaping. Photographs taken by the authors document every aspect of beaver behavior and biology, the variety of their constructions, and the habitats that depend on their presence. Beaver facts:•Just as individual beavers shape their immediate surroundings, so did the distribution of beavers across North America influence the paths of English and French explorers and traders. As a result of the fur trade, beavers were wiped out across large areas of the United States. Reintroduction efforts led to the widespread establishment of these resilient animals, and now they are found throughout North America, Europe, and parts of the southern hemisphere.•Beaver meadows provided early settlers with level, fertile pastures and hayfields.•Based on the fossil record, the smallest extinct beaver species were the size of a muskrat, and the largest may have reached the size of a black bear (five to six times as large as today''s North American beavers). Beaver-gnawed wood has been found alongside the skeleton of a mastodon.•Some beavers remain in the home lodge for an extra year to assist their parents in raising younger siblings. They feed, groom, and guard the newborn kits.•In 1600, beaver ponds covered eleven percent of the upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers'' watershed above Thebes, Illinois.

This handbook is packed with indispensable information, from defining just what a Plant Engineer actually does, through selection of a suitable site for a factory and provision of basic facilities (including boilers, electrical systems, water, HVAC systems, pumping systems and floors and finishes) to issues such as lubrication, corrosion, energy conservation, maintenance and materials handling as well as environmental considerations, insurance matters and financial concerns. One of the major features of this volume is its comprehensive treatment of the maintenance management function; in addition to chapters which outline the operation of the various plant equipment there is specialist advice on how to get the most out of that equipment and its operators. This will enable the reader to reap the rewards of more efficient operations, more effective employee contributions and in turn more profitable performance from the plant and the business to which it contributes. The Editor, Keith Mobley and the team of expert contributors, have practiced at the highest levels in leading corporations across the USA, Europe and the rest of the world.

For decades people have unquestioningly accepted the idea that our goal is to preserve nature in its pristine, pre-human state. But many scientists have come to see this as an outdated dream that thwarts bold new plans to save the environment and prevents us from having a fuller relationship with nature. Humans have changed the landscapes they inhabit since prehistory, and climate change means even the remotest places now bear the fingerprints of humanity. Emma Marris argues convincingly that it is time to look forward and create the "rambunctious garden," a hybrid of wild nature and human management. In this optimistic book, readers meet leading scientists and environmentalists and visit imaginary Edens, designer ecosystems, and Pleistocene parks. Marris describes innovative conservation approaches, including rewilding, assisted migration, and the embrace of so-called novel ecosystems.

Larry Weaner is an icon in the world of ecological landscape design, and now his revolutionary approach is available to all gardeners. Garden Revolution shows how an ecological approach to planting can lead to beautiful gardens that buck much of conventional gardening’s counter-productive, time-consuming practices. Instead of picking the wrong plant and then constantly tilling, weeding, irrigating, and fertilizing, Weaner advocates for choosing plants that are adapted to the soil and climate of a specific site and letting them naturally evolve over time. Allowing the plants to find their own niches, to spread their seed around until they find the microclimate and spot that suits them best, creates a landscape that is vibrant, dynamic, and gorgeous year after year.', DEFAULT, '3.03', '336', '2016-05-18', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8v8MDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Garden Revolution')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

While most of these organizations have no direct connection to human rights issues, their participation in broader IGO networks has important implications for the human rights practices of their member states. Featuring a rigorous empirical analysis, Transmitting Rights shows that countries tend to adopt similar human rights practices to those of their IGO partners, whether for better or worse. Greenhill argues that IGOs constitute a tightly-woven fabric of ties between states and that this network provides an important channel through which states can influence the behavior of others. Indeed, his analysis suggests that a policy of isolating "rogue" states is probably self-defeating given that this will reduce their exposure to some of the more positive IGO-based influences on their human rights.

Although there are no known examples of arch dams which have been seriously damaged by earthquakes, the need for more realistic seismic analyses is now well recognized, not only for new dams but especially in the context of the safety evaluation of existing dams. Fortunately, with the finite element method, engineers have a powerful tool for modeling the complex geometry and the nonlinear material behavior of a dam. However, there is still a major complication in the analysis procedure, namely the interaction of the dam with the reservoir and with the foundation during an earthquake. Interaction is a wave propagation problem involving transmitting boundaries. The State of the Art in engineering practice is to neglect wave propagation by modeling the water as incompressible and the foundation as massless. More advanced analysis methods using compressible water and foundation with mass have been available for some time. However, these methods are restricted to linear models, because they work in the frequency domain. On the other hand, there are also advanced nonlinear models for dams, but they can only be used in the time domain, usually with simple transmitting boundaries. In this report, which is based on an a doctoral thesis, rigorous transmitting boundaries in the time domain are developed which permit combining compressible water with n- linear dam behavior.

First published in 1949, Genesis of a Music is the manifesto of Partch''s radical compositional practice and instruments (which owe nothing to the 300-year-old European tradition of Western music.) He contrasts Abstract and Corporeal music, proclaiming the latter as the vital, emotionally tactile form derived from the spoken word (like Greek, Chinese, Arabic, and Indian musics) and surveys the history of world music at length from this perspective.

In SAP you can verify invoices against purchase orders and goods receipts.

Its all encompassing nature makes SAP complex. In order to derive maximum benefit for business, SAP must be understood well. Mr. Agrawal attempts to explain SAP completely; a seemingly impossible task. This is his third book on the Materials Management module; his first two books in the Materials Management module are ‘Purchasing’ and ‘Inventory Management’. In this book, like in his earlier books, he explains every screen of SAP MM Invoice Verification. Both the SAP Menu and Customizing Implementation Guide are expanded and the chapter number where they are covered is indicated. This not only creates a direct link between the book and the SAP software, but also ensures that the book is comprehensive. The author has taken care to balance details with overviews that explain linkages between concepts. The book is organized in chapters that are important business activities. Each chapter covers business processes carried out in SAP by the user as well as its related configuration. This book can be used to learn SAP from scratch; it is a learning guide. It is, therefore, useful to persons who are training to be SAP Consultants. Having learnt SAP with the help of this book, the Consultant keeps returning to refer to it. In implementation of SAP, Consultants prepare User Manual. With the availability of this book, their task becomes simpler. In the User Manual, they need to cover only implementation specific points.

Adding to the confusion is the fact that it falls between two teams the MM team and the FI team and each assumes that the other is responsible for the design and configuration of Invoice Verification. Although the process can be streamlined, many organizations get the design and use of invoice verification wrong, resulting in vendors not being paid and accounts being placed on stop, which prevents further Purchase Orders from being processed until the vendor has been paid. The aim of this book is to help readers fully understand the invoice verification process, particularly the changes in ERP 6.0. If they get the design right, then the process will run smoothly and vendors will be paid on time (not too early either). User input can be kept to a minimum and much of the process can be automatic. There are one or two basic mistakes that are made during the design of the process and the guide highlights these (and many other confusing areas), and describes, in simple terms, the options available along with the consequences of getting it wrong.

It focusses upon how soft law fits into the Community legal system, and how it is used, and, in particular, how it relates to Community legislation.Differentiation of the Community instruments, including the instruments of soft law, is often thought to enhance the effectiveness, legitimacy and transparency of the Community. This book asks whether soft law indeed provides a satisfactory alternative to legislation from this perspective and, if so, in what cases and under what conditions. Furthermore, the author asks to what extent the use of soft law implies good governance, and throws fresh light on this very heterogenous phenomenon, by looking at frequently used instruments in many different areas of Community law, such as competition law, state aid, environment, social policy etc., in the process identifying their different characteristics, aims, functions and legal effects. What emerges is that the conditions under which soft law is used may be problematic in relation to increasing the legitimacy, effectiveness and transparency of Community action.This is a work which will interest legal practitioners confronted with the use of soft law and the question of its possible legal effect in an increasing number of sectors and academics interested in the vexed question of how the increased use of soft law can be justified in a Community legal order built upon the rule of law.

It is now used frequently—and often incorrectly—by political leaders, editorial writers, and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power—the ability to coerce—grows out of a country''s military or economic might, soft power arises from the attractiveness of a country''s culture, political ideals, and policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It forms the core of the Bush administration''s new national security strategy. But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America''s military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that America better understands and applies our soft power.

China, rich in culture and traditional philosophy, boasts abundant sources of soft power. Soft Power attempts to analyze the domestic and international views of China''s soft power, the main strengths and weaknesses of China''s soft power, and the application of soft power in China''s international politics. It provides a comprehensive exploration of the soft power dimension in China''s foreign relations by integrating views from various disciplines, such as history, education, culture, political economy, comparative politics, and philosophy.

Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth''s writings. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books. To begin the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing three, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which will be published at regular intervals. Each fascicle will encompass a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete. Volume 4, Fascicle 4 This latest fascicle covers the generation of all trees, a basic topic that has surprisingly rich ties to the first three volumes of The Art of Computer Programming. In thoroughly discussing this well-known subject, while providing 124 new exercises, Knuth continues to build a firm foundation for programming. To that same end, this fascicle also covers the history of combinatorial generation.

Dale describes EPICURE, a natural language generating system, and its capacity to create referring expressions in a domain embodying several interesting features: The entities in the domain consist of masses and sets as well as the more usual singular individuals; during the development of a discourse, the entities may take on new properties, existing entities may be destroyed, and new entities may be created; and the discourses within which the entities appear are hierarchically structured, allowing for the integration of discourse-structural constraints on the use of anaphoric expressions. EPICURE is designed to generate text from underlying plans. Dale uses cooking recipes as examples, showing how the system must determine what level of explanation is required and how the events in the plan must be modeled to ensure that the references generated are accurate.

Here food isn’t formal or fussy, just focused, with recipes that honor Italian tradition while celebrating the best ingredients the Pacific Northwest has to offer. We’re talking about a generous bowl of steaming handmade pasta--served with two forks for you and a friend. Or perhaps an impeccably fresh crudo, crunchy cucumber and tangy radish accenting impossibly sweet spot prawns. Next up are the jewel tones of a beet salad with lush, homemade ricotta, or maybe a tangle of white beans and clams spiked with Goat Horn pepper--finished off with a whole roasted fish that begs to be sucked off the bones. Oh, some cheese, a gooseberry compote complementing your Robiola, or the bittersweet surprise of Campari sorbet. This layered approach is a hallmark of Ethan’s restaurants, and in his New Italian Kitchen, he offers home cooks a tantalizing roadmap for re-creating this style of eating. Prepare a feast simply by combining the lighter dishes found in “Nibbles and Bits”—from Sardine Crudo with Celery Hearts, Pine Nuts, and Lemon to Crispy Young Favas with Green Garlic Mayonnaise—or adding recipes with complex flavors for a more sophisticated meal. Try the luscious Corn and Chanterelle Soup from “The Measure of a Cook;” or the Cavatelli with Cuttlefish, Spring Onion, and Lemon from “Wheat’s Highest Calling.” Up the ante with a stunning Duck Leg Farrotto with Pearl Onions and Bloomsdale Spinach from “Starches to Grow On,” or choose one of the “Beasties of the Land,” like Skillet-Roasted Rabbit with Pancetta-Basted Fingerlings. Each combination will nudge you and your guests in new, unexpected, and unforgettable directions.

Carney was an agile, rubber-limbed dancer and comedian whose sweetness and unassuming nature concealed the passion and power of a brilliant, often underappreciated, actor. The partnership formed by Carney and Gleason, as Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden and his dim-witted pal, sewer worker Norton, remains to this day the most powerful and memoriable comedic union ever conceived for television.

In this time, developers and architects have encountered a number of recurring design challenges related to their usage, and have learned that certain service design approaches work better than others to solve certain problems. In Service Design Patterns, Rob Daigneau codifies proven design solutions for web services that follow the REST architectural style or leverage the SOAP/WSDL specifications. This catalogue identifies the fundamental topics in web service design and lists the common design patterns for each topic. All patterns identify the context in which they may be used, explain the constituent design elements, and explore the relative strengths and trade-offs. Code examples are provided to help you better understand how the patterns work but are kept general so that you can see how the solutions may be applied to disparate technologies that will inevitably change in the years to come. This book will help readers answer the following questions: How do you create a web service API, what are the common API styles, and when should a particular style be used? How can clients and web services communicate, and what are the foundations for creating complex conversations in which multiple parties exchange data over extended periods of time? What are the options for implementing web service logic, and when should a particular approach be used? How can clients become less coupled to the underlying systems used by a service? How can information about a web service be discovered? How can generic functions like authentication, validation, caching, and logging be supported on the client or service? What changes to a service cause clients to break? What are the common ways to version a service? How can web services be designed to support the continuing evolution of business logic without forcing clients to constantly upgrade? This book is an invaluable resource for enterprise architects, solution architects, and developers who use web services to create enterprise IT applications, commercial or open source products, and Software as a Service (SaaS) products that leverage emerging Cloud platforms.', DEFAULT, '31.72', '352', '2011-10-25', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=wljJZbEO8ZQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Service Design Patterns')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Foremost on that list is mobility, since going wireless frees you from the tether of an Ethernet cable at a desk. But that''s just the tip of the cable-free iceberg. Wireless networks are also more flexible, faster and easier for you to use, and more affordable to deploy and maintain. The de facto standard for wireless networking is the 802.11 protocol, which includes Wi-Fi (the wireless standard known as 802.11b) and its faster cousin, 802.11g. With easy-to-install 802.11 network hardware available everywhere you turn, the choice seems simple, and many people dive into wireless computing with less thought and planning than they''d give to a wired network.

This updated edition covers everything you''ll ever need to know about wireless technology. Designed with the system administrator or serious home user in mind, it''s a no-nonsense guide for setting up 802.11 on Windows and Linux. Among the wide range of topics covered are discussions on: deployment considerations network monitoring and performance tuning wireless security issues how to use and select access points network monitoring essentials wireless card configuration security issues unique to wireless networks With wireless technology, the advantages to its users are indeed plentiful. Companies no longer have to deal with the hassle and expense of wiring buildings, and households with several computers can avoid fights over who''s online.

In addition, a description of the United States energy infrastructure′s dependency on oil, in relation to energy security in the mission critical industry, is discussed. In conjunction with this, either a new chapter will be created on updated policies and regulations specifically related to the mission critical industry or updates to policies and regulations will be woven into most chapters. The topics addressed throughout this book include safety, fire protection, energy security and data center cooling, along with other common challenges and issues facing industry engineers today.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '512', '2011-08-02', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3yccjnKEyZQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Maintaining Mission Critical Systems in a 24/7 Environment')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Not many, judging by a $15 billion industry. The combination of an ES as a platform for organizational information and Internet technology for gaining access to it adds up to the ideal solution for company-wide data sharing in real time. Not surprisingly, small and large companies worldwide are either considering an ES, in the process of implementing one, or living with the results. Yet, says Tom Davenport, unless managers view ES adoption and implementation as a business decision rather than a technology decision, they may be risking disappointment Mission Criticalpresents an authoritative and no-nonsense view of the ES opportunities and challenges. Suggesting ESs are not the right choice for every company, the author provides a set of guidelines to help managers evaluate the benefits and risks for their organizations. To be successful, argues Davenport, an organization must make simultaneous changes in its information systems, its business processes, and its business strategy. Such changes are described in detail with extensive examples from real organizations. Bolstering his contention that ESs should be viewed as business vs. technology projects, Davenport spells out the specific business change objectives that should be formulated in advance of ES adoption and monitored throughout its implementation. The first strategic guide to the ES decision,Mission Criticalwill be indispensable to general managers and information technology specialists at all stages of the implementation process.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '335', '2000', '3', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=p2kwgnefpQEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Mission Critical')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Based on scrupulous research and extraordinary access to Google, the book takes you inside the creation and growth of a company whose name is a favorite brand and a standard verb recognized around the world. Its stock is worth more than General Motors’ and Ford’s combined, its staff eats for free in a dining room that used to be run by the Grateful Dead’s former chef, and its employees traverse the firm’s colorful Silicon Valley campus on scooters and inline skates. THE GOOGLE STORY is the definitive account of the populist media company powered by the world’s most advanced technology that in a few short years has revolutionized access to information about everything for everybody everywhere. In 1998, Moscow-born Sergey Brin and Midwest-born Larry Page dropped out of graduate school at Stanford University to, in their own words, “change the world” through a search engine that would organize every bit of information on the Web for free. While the company has done exactly that in more than one hundred languages, Google’s quest continues as it seeks to add millions of library books, television broadcasts, and more to its searchable database. Readers will learn about the amazing business acumen and computer wizardry that started the company on its astonishing course; the secret network of computers delivering lightning-fast search results; the unorthodox approach that has enabled it to challenge Microsoft’s dominance and shake up Wall Street. Even as it rides high, Google wrestles with difficult choices that will enable it to continue expanding while sustaining the guiding vision of its founders’ mantra: DO NO EVIL."

It begins by describing the basic concepts of video compression, explains why you might choose a particular compression tool over another, and covers important workflow practices. After the groundwork is laid, readers will learn how to compress their video according to the specific requirements of their projects and will learn some best practices by following the author''s own tips and recipes.

Margaret Atwood’s new novel is so utterly compelling, so prescient, so relevant, so terrifyingly-all-too-likely-to-be-true, that readers may find their view of the world forever changed after reading it. This is Margaret Atwood at the absolute peak of her powers. For readers of Oryx and Crake, nothing will ever look the same again. The narrator of Atwood''s riveting novel calls himself Snowman. When the story opens, he is sleeping in a tree, wearing an old bedsheet, mourning the loss of his beloved Oryx and his best friend Crake, and slowly starving to death. He searches for supplies in a wasteland where insects proliferate and pigoons and wolvogs ravage the pleeblands, where ordinary people once lived, and the Compounds that sheltered the extraordinary. As he tries to piece together what has taken place, the narrative shifts to decades earlier. How did everything fall apart so quickly? Why is he left with nothing but his haunting memories? Alone except for the green-eyed Children of Crake, who think of him as a kind of monster, he explores the answers to these questions in the double journey he takes - into his own past, and back to Crake''s high-tech bubble-dome, where the Paradice Project unfolded and the world came to grief. With breathtaking command of her shocking material, and with her customary sharp wit and dark humour, Atwood projects us into an outlandish yet wholly believable realm populated by characters who will continue to inhabit our dreams long after the last chapter.

In 2007, Mary Anne returned from a humanitarian trip to Pakistan and Afghanistan suffering from what her doctors believed was a rare type of hepatitis. Months later she was diagnosed with a form of advanced pancreatic cancer, which is almost always fatal, often in six months or less. This is the inspiring true story of a son and his mother, who start a “book club” that brings them together as her life comes to a close. Over the next two years, Will and Mary Anne carry on conversations that are both wide-ranging and deeply personal, prompted by an eclectic array of books and a shared passion for reading. Their list jumps from classic to popular, from poetry to mysteries, from fantastic to spiritual. The issues they discuss include questions of faith and courage as well as everyday topics such as expressing gratitude and learning to listen. Throughout, they are constantly reminded of the power of books to comfort us, astonish us, teach us, and tell us what we need to do with our lives and in the world. Reading isn’t the opposite of doing; it’s the opposite of dying. Will and Mary Anne share their hopes and concerns with each other—and rediscover their lives—through their favorite books. When they read, they aren’t a sick person and a well person, but a mother and a son taking a journey together. The result is a profoundly moving tale of loss that is also a joyful, and often humorous, celebration of life: Will’s love letter to his mother, and theirs to the printed page.

It''s really not an everyday type of prayer. It''s a prayer birthed under pressure, sometimes heartache or grief. It can be triggered by a sudden revelation of hope: an answer to prayer, a promise freshly received, a miracle that lies just over the horizon... This book will help you to pray - effectively - for your nation, for your family, and for yourself. In it, Anne answers such questions as... Does God only hear the prayers of good people? How do I know the God to whom I pray will listen? How do I know God cares about my prayer? How do I know God will answer my prayer? Why should I pray at all? Does it matter where I am when I pray? Are words in prayer all that matter, or does my attitude affect prayer? And most crucial of all - what difference does my prayer actually make? Join Anne in a thrilling discovery of prayer that really works.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '240', '2016-05-19', '22', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=P6EwCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api', 'The Daniel Prayer')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Are you 30, 60, or even 90 days late on several accounts? If so, you aren’t alone. According to a January 2010 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, there are 609.8 million credit cards held by U.S. consumers, and the average credit card debt per household is $15,519. In the last 12 months, 15 percent of American adults, or nearly 34 million people, have been late making a credit card payment, and 8 percent (18 million people) have missed a payment entirely, according to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. If these statistics hit home for you, don’t turn to bankruptcy to solve your financial woes. This book will provide you with the tools to legally settle your credit card accounts — without ruining your financial situation for years to come. How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar is for everyone who is unable to pay mounting minimum payments on their credit cards. You will learn everything you need to know about the basics of credit card debt, including interest rates, finance charges, minimum payments, and late fees. Discover what actually happens to your credit when you are late making your payments or stop making payments altogether and how long it takes before your credit cards debt is sold to a collection agency. This book will provide tips and strategies for negotiating with your original creditor and collection agencies and sample settlement letters you can use when working with creditors. Equip yourself with proven strategies for legally challenging the validity of your credit card debt and information on how to determine whether your rights are being violated under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You will find out the advantages of not filing bankruptcy and how to work with credit counselors and avoid debt-reduction scams. Once you have successfully settled your debt and avoided bankruptcy, you will learn how to avoid repeating these mistakes in the future by setting budgets, cutting costs, and lowering interest rates. Learn how the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which went into effect in February 2010, affects you as a consumer. While these new rules do not absolve consumers of their obligations, they do mean that credit card companies can no longer retroactively increase rates, charge misleading late fees, or use over-limit fee traps. We have spent hundreds of hours interviewing top financial experts, bill collectors, and individuals just like you who were able to legally settle their credit card debt without resorting to bankruptcy. If you are tired of dodging phone calls from collectors or worrying about how missed payments have ruined your credit score, get yourself back to a more stable financial situation — one where credit card debt is a thing of the past.', DEFAULT, '9.99', '288', '2010', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B5lUh_vDLQwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'How to Legally Settle Your Personal Credit Card Debt for Pennies on the Dollar')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Used in the exploration and discovery phase of a field, they are performed to determine the quality of a well or to permit estimation of producing rates at different producing pressures. However once a field enters the middle and later development phase, the reservoir flow environment grows increasingly complex and conventional or modern methods do not satisfy the needs of old field development and evaluation. Based on over 10 years of field and research experience, Streamline Numerical Well Test Interpretation Theory and Method provides an effective method for the determination of residual oil distribution for the middle and mature phases of a field. One of the most advanced books available, the author explains the development history of well test theory, analyzes the limitation of modern well test interpretation method, and proposes the concept and framework of numerical well test. This is quickly followed by an introduction of basic principles and solution procedures of streamline numerical simulation theory and method. The book then systematically applies streamline numerical well test interpretation models to a multitude of reservoir types, ranging from single layer reservoir to multi-layer reservoirs. The book presents multi-parameter streamline numerical well test automatic match interpretation method based on double-population genetic algorithm, which lays the foundation to fast automatic match of numerical well test. The book introduces streamline numerical well test interpretation software with independent intellectual property right which is programmed based on the above theoretical studies. Single and muti-layer sandstone water flooding reservoirs Multi-layer sandstone chemical flooding model and components Explains the application of streamline numerical well test and software Applies programmed software to 177 wells Quickly calculate the distribution of pressure, saturation and streamline Covers all kinds of numerical well test interpretation models Avoid the disadvantages of conventional well test and numerical well test interpretation method Complete tutorial on streamline numerical well test interpretation software', DEFAULT, '99.2', '328', '2011-08-30', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V5SuHp5s9BAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Streamline Numerical Well Test Interpretation')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Additional studies of the ES cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as protocols for the use of ES cells to generate diverse cell and tissue types, complete this collection of readily reproducible methods. Many of the techniques have already been shown to have tremendous utility with ES cells and their differentiated progeny.

He answers these questions and explains why traditional paradigms are not psycholinguistically motivated. Drawing on research from both first and second language acquisition, he outlines a model for input processing in second language acquisition that helps to account for how learners construct grammatical systems.

In the AFC Championship game, to the surprise and dismay of virtually everyone, Rick actually gets into the game. With a seventeen-point lead and just minutes to go, Rick provides what is arguably the worst single performance in the history of the NFL. Overnight, he becomes a national laughingstock—and is immediately cut by the Browns and shunned by all other teams. But all Rick knows is football, and he insists that his agent find a team that needs him. Against enormous odds, Rick finally gets a job—as the starting quarterback for the Mighty Panthers . . . of Parma, Italy. The Parma Panthers desperately want a former NFL player—any former NFL player—at their helm. And now they’ve got Rick, who knows nothing about Parma (not even where it is) and doesn’t speak a word of Italian. To say that Italy—the land of fine wines, extremely small cars, and football americano—holds a few surprises for Rick Dockery would be something of an understatement.

There are countless ways to create the dish called pizza, as well as a never-ending debate on the best way of cooking it. Now Carol Helstosky documents the fascinating history and cultural life of this chameleon-like food in Pizza. Originally a food for the poor in eighteenth-century Naples, the pizza is a source of national and regional pride as well as cultural identity in Italy, Helstosky reveals. In the twentieth century, the pizza followed Italian immigrants to America, where it became the nation’s most popular dish and fueled the rise of successful fast-food corporations such as Pizza Hut and Domino’s. Along the way, Helstosky explains, pizza has been adapted to local cuisines and has become a metaphor for cultural exchange. Pizza also features several recipes and a wealth of illustrations, including a photo of the world’s largest and most expensive pizza—sprinkled with edible 24-karat gold shavings and costing over $4000.

Allegiances run from the general (Chicago versus New York style, Neapolitan versus Roman) to the particular (Pepe''s versus Sally''s, Gino''s East versus Pizzeria Uno), and new interpretations ever extend the pizza frontier.In AMERICAN PIE, master bread baker Peter Reinhart follows the trail from Italy to the States, capturing the stories behind the greatest artisanal pizzas of the Old World and the New. Beginning his journey in Genoa, Reinhart scours the countryside in search of the fabled focaccia col formaggio. He next heads to Rome to sample the famed seven-foot-long pizza al taglio, and then to Naples for the archetypal pizza napoletana. Back in America, the hunt resumes in the unlikely locale of Phoenix, Arizona, where Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco has convinced many that his pie sets the new standard in the country. The pizza mecca of New Haven, grilled pizza in Providence, the deep-dish pies of Chicago, California-style pizza in San Francisco and Los Angeles—these are just a few of the tasty attractions on Reinhart''s epic tour. Returning to the kitchen, Reinhart gives a master class on pizza-making techniques and provides more than 60 recipes for doughs, sauces and toppings, and the pizzas that bring them all together. His insatiable curiosity and gift for storytelling make AMERICAN PIE essential reading for those who aspire to make great pizza at home, as well as for anyone who enjoys the thrill of the hunt. A fascinating look into the great pizzas and pizzerias of Italy and America. Peter Reinhart''s last book, THE BREAD BAKER''S APPRENTICE, was named Cookbook of the Year by both the James Beard Foundation and the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Reviews“Peter Reinhart has taken a deep look into pizza, one of the best and simplest of foods, embracing all its variety. He probes American pizza especially, but he has tasted the original in Naples and visited elsewhere in Italy to learn about variations and relatives. He tells vivid stories, and his recipes and techniques are thorough and practical. A splendid book.”—Edward Behr, editor, The Art of Eating“I doubt whether anyone else could be as passionate as Peter Reinhart about pizzas or have made such extensive and exciting journeys in pursuing them. He has collected great anecdotes and wonderfully detailed recipes in the course of his intercontinental hunt.”—Alan Davidson, author of The Oxford Companion to Food“We all know that Peter Reinhart is a great baker and teacher, but now that he''s fallen in love with pizza, we can see he''s also a great tour guide as he takes us to the best pizzerias in Italy and America. Secrets are divulged, expert tips provided, and stories told.

Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian--the conversation begins with "no"; why "Budgeting Doesn''t Have to Suck!"; how to get things rolling--for real--with only $20; what most people don''t understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food.

Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.

One policy that meets these criteria and warrants consideration is a farm savings account (FSA). It is crucial that the role of a FSA in a farm household''s portfolio is understood before implementing it as policy. Consequently, this research uses a discrete stochastic programming model to investigate the relationship between the FSA and the portfolio allocation choices (consumption, land allocation, stock, and debt) for a utility-maximizing farmer in a theoretical and empirical framework. This analysis shows that a FSA can help stabilize, enhance, and/or reduce the variability in wealth. The results also suggest that the availability of a FSA as an investment has significant impact on the asset allocation patterns for the household. First, the presence of matching government contributions motivates the household in ever year when they have sufficient cash to contribute funds to the FSA to receive these government contributions. This result occurs irrespective of the initial endowments, risk aversion level, and presence of other U.S. farm policies. Access to the FSA causes the household to decrease purchases of stocks compared to a household without access to the FSA. Second, the powerful income protection effects of the FSA help explain the observed willingness of the household to make annual land purchase decisions that are far larger than in the scenario without the FSA. In turn, this causes the household to have a much larger percentage of its assets financed with debt capital. The availability of a FSA results in modest increases in average terminal wealth, lower variability in terminal wealth, and no significant change in average annual consumption, but lower variability in consumption. Finally, as the amount of farmland in the portfolio grows, a decrease in the probability of a withdrawal and an increase in the size of the average withdrawal from the FSA can be observed. These results are consistent with prior research on the National Income Stabilization Account (NISA), a Canadian farm policy similar to the FSA.', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '287', '2007', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4q7rZArbASYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'The Effect of Farm Savings Accounts on Farm Households'' Portfolios')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The mobile user seeks for facilitation of his daily habits and companies anticipate generating high revenue stream through new mobile applications. After telecommunication companies have paid high prices for the UMTS licenses in Europe M-Commerce has started to be the new hype. In those countries which did not have auctions but beauty contests M-Commerce has been also shifted into the spotlight. Although M-Commerce is still in its infancy, it predicts to have a huge impact on many ways of people s lives. New buzz words like anywhere and anytime have evolved in order to describe the great potential of M-Commerce. Growth opportunities in terms of new arising mobile business models seem promising but only the future will be able to answer the question of success. Mobile devices offer a broad range of opportunities from entertainment service e.g. music, games or video up to transactions e.g. banking, shopping, auctions. It is still unclear if all the emerging opportunities can be commercialized successfully. Nevertheless, many scenarios of how the world could be like in the future have been made. Below an excerpt of the daily routine of a future mobile user is presented: Nancy D`Amato prepares to leave her office just before five o clock. She uses her mobile phone for a quick check of the local weather forecast, sees that fines conditions are expected for the evening, and decides to leave her umbrella by her desk. Nancy is due to meet her boyfriend Peter at seven o clock, so she has two hours in town to waste. As soon as the clock reaches five, she receives a text message telling her that the bar across the street has a happy hour when drinks are cheaper. Nancy deletes the message almost without reading it. She has given her mobile service provider permission to send her unsolicited local promotional messages after five - otherwise she would have to pay a higher subscription rates - but that does not mean she actually has to read the message, does it? Five minutes later another message arrives, with a coupon offering a discount at the local branch of her favorite coffee bar. She shows the coffee-shop attendant the numbered message on her phone s screen, and he keys in the number on the till when charging for the coffee. Now comfortably seated with her cappuccino, Nancy begins to plan her evening. She uses her mobile to check which movies are showing nearby after seven o clock, and soon finds one she likes with seats still available. [ ] It is better to send the details of the film to Peter as a message. She quickly sends him the cinema web address, which shows the time and location of the cinema - he can always get the review from there if he wants it - together with a few well-chosen words suggesting that it might be a good idea for him to agree to see this one. [ ] Perhaps a little retail therapy would be more relaxing. Using her mobile again, she checks to see which local shops have sales and special offers available, and soon discovers that a shoe shop is offering a promotional price on a brand she loves. She did not know the shop, but a few clicks on the mobile obtains walking directions from the coffee bar. [ ] She has just stepped into the shop when Peter replies to her earlier message. He has agreed to her choice of film, so she quickly books the tickets, which are now sent to her mobile for display at the cinema. She then searches for a restaurant nearby for dinner after the film. She knows Peter likes Chinese, and she owes him something for agreeing to her choice, so she finds a local restaurant and books a table for nine o clock. More than any other marketing medium, the mobile device makes one-to-one marketing reality. It gives marketers an unprecedented communication channel to deliver promotions, coupons, value-added information and other services that are uniquely personalized to the customers needs. But only if all marketing activities can incorporate the theme of permission marketing the future of Mobile-Commerce advertising will be prosperous. It will become of greater importance in M-Commerce to have a precise idea of customer s needs and preferences. New Business Models that have the ability to capture information about mobile users and use this data for commercial purposes like M-Advertising are necessary. Information Intermediaries (Infomediaries) are such a business model. Collected customer profiles may then be used to the customer s advantage so as to offer them exactly what they want. Advertisers have the opportunity to target their consumers with highly personalized and relevant services. Mobile devices, used for business and pleasure, are accessible 24 hours and 7 days per week and are rarely shared with others. They are like a personal extension of you . However, with this great opportunity of highly targeted marketing comes a range of extraordinary responsibilities to ensure customer satisfaction and to avoid spam or abuse of personal customer information. Nevertheless, if this mobile opportunity is handled with sensitivity and intelligence the advertising industry can generate high revenues. In fact, in Germany over 1 mil. mobile users have already subscribed to permission-based advertising. At this point the question may arise of how to handle the mobile channel correctly to ensure its success. This is the main focus of this thesis. It will give a possible business model for M-Commerce advertising. The concepts of infomediary and permission marketing are carefully examined and incorporated in the M-Commerce environment. Both concepts will be converged in order to derive to a Permission Marketing Infomediation (PMI) model. This thesis will concentrate on the following research questions: How can infomediaries use permission marketing for advertising activities in B2C M-Commerce? Why is the combined approach of Permission Marketing Infomediaries advantageous? General investigations on the Internet and in libraries will give the theoretical input for the concepts and models in my thesis. In addition some case examples of various companies that are aligned with the PMI approach is envisaged in order to compile empirical data. The thesis is divided into six different parts: Part 1: Introduction The first part will give an introduction to the M-Commerce market and its characteristics. Parts 2: Permission Marketing The emerging marketing strategy of permission will be presented in accordance with its main protectionist Seth Godin. It will be shown how this concept can be used for targeted advertising messages in M-Commerce. Part 3: Mobile-Infomediaries The revolutionary business model of infomediaries stamped by the McKinsey Consultants John Hagel III and Marc Singer will be reviewed here. The infomediary model will be applied to M-Commerce and will be describe according to its services to customers and vendors. Moreover, the process of building a infomediary will be shown in addition to benefits and challenges of this business model. Part 4: Permission Marketing Infomediation In this section the two approaches of permission marketing and infomediary will be combined for M-Commerce advertising. The developed model will be compared to other ways of marketing (direct relationship marketing and interruption marketing). The chapter about location-based-advertising will then illustrate how this model can be utilized. Part 5: Empirical Survey Five case examples will give empirical insight into the topic of M-Commerce advertising. Appropriate empirical evidence can support the developed model of Permission Marketing Infomediation. At the end the results of each case example are opposed in a table. Part 6: Conclusion The last section will draw a final conclusion and give a look into the future of M-Commerce. The research question will be viewed again in order to show that it has been answered throughout the thesis.

In it, the authors ask: how do ICTs empower through participation, transparency and accountability? Specifically, the authors examine two principal questions: Are technologies an accelerator to closing the “accountability gap” – the space between the supply (governments, service providers) and demand (citizens, communities, civil society organizations or CSOs) that requires bridging for open and collaborative governance? And under what conditions does this occur? The introductory chapters lay the theoretical groundwork for understanding the potential of technologies to achieving intended goals. Chapter 1 takes us through the theoretical linkages between empowerment, participation, transparency and accountability. In Chapter 2, the authors devise an informational capability framework, relating human abilities and well-being to the use of ICTs. The chapters to follow highlight practical examples that operationalize ICT-led initiatives. Chapter 3 reviews a sample of projects targeting the goals of transparency and accountability in governance to make preliminary conclusions around what evidence exists to date, and where to go from here. In chapter 4, the author reviews the process of interactive community mapping (ICM) with examples that support general local development and others that mitigate natural disasters. Chapter 5 examines crowdsourcing in fragile states to track aid flows, report on incitement or organize grassroots movements. In chapter 6, the author reviews Check My School (CMS), a community monitoring project in the Philippines designed to track the provision of services in public schools. Chapter 7 introduces four key ICT-led, citizen-governance initiatives in primary health care in Karnataka, India. Chapter 8 analyzes the World Bank Institute’s use of ICTs in expanding citizen project input to understand the extent to which technologies can either engender a new “feedback loop” or ameliorate a “broken loop”. The authors’ analysis of the evidence signals ICTs as an accelerator to closing the “accountability gap”. In Chapter 9, the authors conclude with the Loch Ness model to illustrate how technologies contribute to shrinking the gap, why the gap remains open in many cases, and what can be done to help close it. This collection is a critical addition to existing literature on ICTs and citizen engagement for two main reasons: first, it is expansive, covering initiatives that leverage a wide range of technology tools, from mobile phone reporting to crowdsourcing to interactive mapping; second, it is the first of its kind to offer concrete recommendations on how to close feedback loops.', DEFAULT, '19.24', '328', '2014-05-29', DEFAULT, 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AjHKAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Closing the Feedback Loop')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

Much of this development work resides in industrial reports, feasibility study papers and the reports of advanced collaborative projects. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of such new work in all aspects of industrial control for wider and rapid dissemination. From time to time a particular practical control problem emerges as a challenge to the design capabilities of the control community. One example has been the activated sludge process in wastewater systems where the process is highly nonlinear and measurements are few. A second example is the hard disk drive servo system. These widely used systems are critical to the operation of modem computing devices.

Although Shane had repeatedly expressed apprehension about his work with a Chinese company and fear his life was being threatened, authorities immediately ruled his death a suicide. His family initially didn’t know what to believe. However, upon arriving in Singapore, they realized the evidence suggested not suicide, but murder. Shane’s family later discovered that what they thought was a computer speaker was actually an external hard drive with thousands of files from Shane’s computer. The information in those files transformed this story from a tragic suicide to an international saga of mystery, deceit, and cover-up, involving three countries. “Hard Drive: A Families Fight against Three Countries” is the captivating story of Shane’s mysterious death and his family’s grueling battle to reveal the truth against powerful forces that have sought to conceal, destroy, or discredit evidence indicating homicide.

In A Popular History of Minnesota, historian Norman K. Risjord offers a grand tour of the state''s remarkable history, taking readers through the centuries and into the lives of those colorful characters who populate Minnesota''s past. This highly readable volume details everything from the glacial formation of the land to the arrival of the Dakota and the Ojibwe people, from Minnesota''s contributions to the Northern cause during the Civil War to the key players in reform politics who helped sculpt the identity of the state today. A Popular History of Minnesota highlights the historical significance of Minnesota''s natural resources--the bountiful north woods, the treasured iron ranges, the impressive Mississippi waterfall on which the Mill City was built. It details the powerful marks left on the state by such luminous figures as Oliver H. Kelley, founder of the national Grange movement, Hubert H. Humphrey, champion of civil rights, and Betty Crocker, aid to homemakers everywhere. Lively sidebars outline noteworthy subjects, from the Kensington runestone to the devastating forest fires of the 1890s and 1910s, from the rise of the Mayo Clinic to the preservation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

Renowned Minnesota architecture critic and historian Larry Millett conducts us on an eye-opening, spectacularly illustrated tour of this rich and varied landscape, with its graphic insights into the building of midcentury Middle America. A history lesson as entertaining as it is enlightening, Minnesota Modern provides a close-up view of a style that penetrated the social, political, and cultural machinery of the times. Extending from modest suburban ramblers and ranch houses to the grandest public and commercial structures, midcentury modernism expressed a whole way of thinking about how to live, work, and play in communities that sprang up as thousands of military members returned from World War II. Millett describes the style''s sources--in the work of European masters like Ludvig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius, as well as the midwestern innovations of Frank Lloyd Wright--and its refinement at the University of Minnesota under the guidance of Ralph Rapson and other modernists. He shows us its applications in twelve midcentury homes in Minnesota and takes us through its many permutations in sites as different as Barry Byrne''s intimate St. Columba Catholic Church in St. Paul and Eero Saarinen''s sprawling IBM complex in Rochester.

Such volumes will require active farming programs and olive trees for new orchards and the replacement of olive trees in existing orchards. As the olive industry moves from traditional manual methods to mechanised operations, planting stock will need to be developed to meet future challenges.

Through several sample projects, you’ll learn how Spring Data provides a consistent programming model that retains NoSQL-specific features and capabilities, and helps you develop Hadoop applications across a wide range of use-cases such as data analysis, event stream processing, and workflow. You’ll also discover the features Spring Data adds to Spring’s existing JPA and JDBC support for writing RDBMS-based data access layers. Learn about Spring’s template helper classes to simplify the use of database-specific functionality Explore Spring Data’s repository abstraction and advanced query functionality Use Spring Data with Redis (key/value store), HBase (column-family), MongoDB (document database), and Neo4j (graph database) Discover the GemFire distributed data grid solution Export Spring Data JPA-managed entities to the Web as RESTful web services Simplify the development of HBase applications, using a lightweight object-mapping framework Build example big-data pipelines with Spring Batch and Spring Integration', DEFAULT, DEFAULT, '288', '2012-10-24', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Mk4HcBE9WYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Spring Data')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

The book links the environmental movement that emerged in the 1960s to earlier movements that had not previously been defined as environmental. It was the first to consider the importance of race, ethnicity, class, and gender issues in the history and evolution of environmentalism. This revised edition extends the groundbreaking history and analysis of Forcing the Spring into the present day. It updates the original with important new material that brings the book''s themes and arguments into the 21st century, addressing topics such as: the controversy spawned by the original edition with regard to how environmentalism is, or should be, defined; new groups and movements that have formed in the past decade; change and development in the overall environmental movement from 1993 to 2004; the changing role of race, class, gender, and ethnicity in today''s environmentalism; the impact of the 2004 presidential election; the emergence of "the next environmentalism." Forcing the Spring, Revised Edition considers environmentalism as a contemporary movement focused on "where we live, work, and play," touching on such hot-button topics as globalization, food, immigration, and sprawl. The book also describes the need for a "next environmentalism" that can address current challenges, and considers the barriers and opportunities associated with this new, more expansive approach. Forcing the Spring, Revised Edition is an important contribution for students and faculty in a wide variety of fields including history, sociology, political science, environmental studies, environmental history, and social movements. It also offers useful context and analysis for anyone concerned with environmental issues.', DEFAULT, '29.22', '448', '2005-06-20', '1', 'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lR0n6oqMNPkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api', 'Forcing the Spring')ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

For the better part of the twentieth century Wedekind''s intense body of work was largely unpublished and rarely performed. Yet the play''s subject matter—teenage desire, suicide, abortion, and homosexuality—is as explosive and important today as it was acentury ago. Spring Awakening follows the lives of three teenagers, Melchior, Moritz, and Wendl, as they navigate their entry into sexual awareness. Unlike so many works that claim to tell the truth of adolescence, Spring Awakening offers no easy answers or redemption. Today, one hundred years after the play''s first performance, a new musical version of this essential modern masterpiece is being hailed as the "best new musical . . . in a generation" (John Heilpern, The New York Observer).

The next stage in the food revolution--a radical way to select fruits and vegetables and reclaim the flavor and nutrients we''ve lost.

Unwittingly, we''ve been selecting plants that are high in starch and sugar and low in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants for more than 400 generations. EATING ON THE WILD SIDE reveals the solution--choosing modern varieties that approach the nutritional content of wild plants but that also please the modern palate. Jo Robinson explains that many of these newly identified varieties can be found in supermarkets and farmer''s market, and introduces simple, scientifically proven methods of preparation that enhance their flavor and nutrition.
